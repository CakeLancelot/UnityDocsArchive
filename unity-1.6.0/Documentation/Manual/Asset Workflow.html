<p>Here we'll explain the steps to use a single asset with Unity.  These steps are general and are meant only as an overview for basic actions.  For the example, we'll talk about using a 3D mesh.
</p>

<h2>Create Rough Asset</h2>

<p>Use any supported 3D modeling package to create a rough version of your asset.  Our example will use Maya.  Work with the asset until you are ready to save.
</p>

<h2>Import</h2>

<p>When you save your asset initially, you should save it directly to the assets folder in your project folder.  Use the normal Save As dialog for Mac OS X.  When you open the Unity project, the asset will be detected and imported into the project.  When you look in the Project View, you'll see the asset located there.
</p>

<h2>Import Settings</h2>

<p>If you select the asset and click the Import Settings button, a dialog with different options for importing the asset will appear.  The options that are displayed will change based on the type of asset that is selected.
</p>

<h2>Adding Asset to the Scene</h2>

<p>Simply click and drag the mesh from the Project View to the Hierarchy or Scene Views to add it to the scene.  When you drag a mesh to the scene, you are creating a Game Object that has a Mesh Renderer Component.  If you are working with a texture or a sound file, you will have to add it to a Game Object that is already in the scene.
</p>

<h2>Putting Different Assets Together</h2>

<p>Here is a brief description of the relationships between the most common assets
</p>

<ul><li> A Texture is applied to a Material
</li><li> A Material is applied to a Game Object (with a Mesh Renderer Component)
</li><li> An Animation is applied to a Game Object (with an Animation Component)
</li><li> A Sound file is applied to a Game Object (with an Audio Source Component)
</li></ul>

<h2>Creating a Prefab</h2>

<p>Prefabs are a collection of Game Objects &amp; Components that can be re-used in your scenes.  Several identical objects can be created from a single Prefab, called <b>cloning</b> or <b>instancing</b>.  Take trees for example.  Creating a tree Prefab will allow you to clone several identical trees and place them in your scene.  Because the trees are all linked to the Prefab, any changes that are made to the Prefab will automatically be applied to all other trees.  So if you want to change the mesh, material, or anything else, you just make the change once in the Prefab and all the other trees inherit the change.  This can save you lots of time during setup and updating of assets.
</p>

<p>When you have a Game Object that contains multiple Components and a hierarchy of other Game Objects, you can make a Prefab of the top-most Game Object, and re-use the entire collection of Components &amp; Game Objects as Prefab clones.
</p>

<p>Think of a Prefab as a blueprint for a structure of GameObjects.  All the Prefab clones are identical to the blueprint.  Therefore, if the blueprint is updated, so are all the clones.  There are different ways you can update the Prefab itself by changing one of its clones and applying those changes to the blueprint.  To read more about using and updating Prefabs, please view the <a href="../Manual/Prefabs.html">Prefabs</a> page.
</p>

<p>To actually create a Prefab from a Game Object in your scene, first create a new Prefab in your Project View.  Name the new Prefab whatever you like.  Then, click on the Game Object in the scene that you want to make into a Prefab.  Drag it to the new Prefab, and you should see the Game Object's name text turn blue.  You have now created a re-usable prefab.
</p>

<h2>Updating Assets</h2>

<p>You have imported, instantiated, and linked your asset to a Prefab.  Now when you want to update your asset, just double-click it from the Project View.  The appropriate application will launch, and you can make any changes you want.  When you're done updating it, just Save it.  Then, when you switch back to Unity, the update will be detected, and the asset will be re-imported.  The asset's link to the Prefab will also be maintained.  So the effect you will see is that your Prefab will update.  That's all you have to know to update assets.  Just open it and save!
