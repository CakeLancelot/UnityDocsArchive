<p>Occlusion Culling is a feature that disables rendering of objects that are not currently seen by the camera because they are hidden from view by other objects. This does not happen automatically in 3D computer graphics since most of the time objects furthest away from the camera are drawn first and subsequent objects are drawn overtop of them. This is called overdraw. Occlusion Culling is different than Frustum Culling. Frustum Culling only disables the renderers for objects that are outside of the camera's viewing area but does not disable the rendering of objects that are hidden from view due to overdraw.  Note that when you use Occlusion Culling you will still benefit from Frustum Culling.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Setting up Occlusion Culling</h2>
<p>In order to use Occlusion Culling, there is some manual setup involved.  First, your level geometry must be broken into sensibly sized pieces. It is also helpful to lay out your levels into small, well defined areas that are occluded from each other by large objects such as walls, buildings, etc.  The idea here is that each individual mesh will be turned on or off based on the occlusion data.  So if you have one object that is all the furniture in your room, only the entire set of furniture will be culled.  This doesn't make nearly as much sense as making each piece of furniture its own mesh, so each can individually be culled based on the camera's view point.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>First, you need to tag all the objects in your Scene that you want to be part of the occlusion to Static in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Inspector</span>. The fastest way to do this is to parent the objects you want to be Static to an Empty <span class='doc-keyword'>GameObject</span> and change the parent to Static. This will change all the child objects to Static as well. After they are tagged as Static you can unparent them from the Empty <span class='doc-keyword'>GameObject</span>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Occlusion Culling-0.jpg' /><br /><em>The Static checkbox in the Inspector</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Next, use a new type of GameObject called the <span class='doc-keyword'>View Area</span>.  You create it from <span class='doc-menu'>GameObject-&gt;Create Other-&gt;View Area</span>.  This object is used to create your occlusion culling.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Occlusion Culling-1.jpg' /><br /><em>The View Area GameObject</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Moving/Animated <span class='doc-keyword'>GameObjects</span> may also be part of the Occlusion Culling solution, but they must be inside user defined <span class='doc-keyword'>Bounding Volume Areas</span> to be occluded. Create a <span class='doc-keyword'>Bounding Volume Area</span> from <span class='doc-menu'>GameObject-&gt;Create Other-&gt;Bounding Volume Area</span>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Occlusion Culling-2.jpg' /><br /><em>The Bounding Volume Area GameObject</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>You'll now use these View Areas to determine the occlusion that will be generated.  You basically use one View Area per room.  You can also use one View Area per height level of the environment.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Occlusion Culling-3.jpg' /><br /><em>Multiple View Areas and Bounding Volume Areas set up in a real-world scenario</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Using the transform tools, scale up the x and z of the <span class='doc-keyword'>View Area</span> until is as close to the edge of the room geometry as possible, but does not expand past the extents.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In the Inspector, change the <span class='doc-prop'>Cell Size</span> to determine the total number of cells inside the current <span class='doc-keyword'>View Area</span>.  What you're trying to do here is create cells large enough that there aren't too many, but small enough that some of them can share the same occlusion data.  This requires a bit of trial and error, and it'll make more sense after we generate occlusion.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>When you're ready to generate occlusion, go to <span class='doc-menu'>Edit-&gt;Generate Occlusion</span> and pick between <span class='doc-menu'>Preview</span>, <span class='doc-menu'>Build Preview</span>, and <span class='doc-menu'>Build Release</span>. Preview is the quickest way to generate data and should be used to test out your view areas in the authoring tool. Build Preview should be used for a test run on your target platfrom (e.g. iPhone) to get an idea of what performance you will likely get. When are you ready to release you should use Build Release to generate your occlusion.  After the processing is done, you should see some colorful cubes in the View Area.  The colored areas are spots that share the same occlusion data.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Testing the generated occlusion</h2>
<p>After your occlusion is set up, you can test it out by selecting the <span class='doc-keyword'>Occlusion Mode</span> in the Scene View and moving the <span class='doc-keyword'>Main Camera</span> around.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Occlusion Culling-4.jpg' /><br /><em>The Occlusion View mode in Scene View</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>As you move the Main Camera around (whether in Play mode or not), you'll see various objects disable themselves.  The thing you are looking for here is any error in the occlusion data.  You'll recognize an error if you see objects popping into view as you move around.  If this happens, your options for fixing the error are either changing the Cell Size, or moving objects around to cover up the error.  While debugging problems with occlusion, you can move the Main Camera to the problematic position and use <span class='doc-menu'>Edit-&gt;Generate Occlusion-&gt;Single Cell</span> to spot-check the problem without regenerating all the occlusion data.  This will clear out any previously generated occlusion data, so you'll have to regenerate the full set of occlusion data before it will work properly again.
