		<!-- #TemplateBeginEditable name="body" -->
			
<p><span class='doc-keyword'>Tree</span> allows you to create and edit procedural trees. Example trees:
</p><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/class-Tree-0.jpg' /><br /></div>
<h1>Tree Editor</h1>
<p>The Tree Editor is split into several different panels. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/class-Tree-1.jpg' /><br /></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Hierachy view</h1>
<p>The hierachy view is where you start building your tree. It shows a schematic representation of the tree, where each box is a group of nodes. By selecting one of the groups in the hierachy you can modify it's properties. You may also add or remove groups by clicking one of the buttons displayed immediately above the hierachy.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Add Leaves</span></td><td >Add a leaf group to the currently selected group. Once the leaf group is added, you can modify it from the panel below the hierachy view.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Add Branches</span></td><td >Add a branch group to the currently selected group. Once the branch group is added, you can modify it from the panel below the hierachy view.</td></tr>
<tr ><td ><span class='doc-prop'>Delete Selected</span></td><td >Deletes the currently selected node, group or spline point.</td></tr>
</table>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Tree Editing Tools </h1>
<p>While the Tree Editor works with procedural elements, you can at any time decide to modify them by hand to achieve the exact shape you want. By using the Tree Editing Tools, you can quickly and easily adjust the shape.
Once you have edited a group by hand, it will be locked so that certain procedural properties are no longer available. You can however always revert a group to be procedural by clicking the button displayed below the editing tools.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Move</span></td><td >Select a node or spline point in the scene view, and drag it around. Movement always happens on a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Rotate</span></td><td >Select a node or spline point in the scene view and drag to rotate it. Rotation always happens around an axis parallel to the viewing direction.</td></tr>
<tr ><td ><span class='doc-prop'>Free Hand Drawing</span></td><td >Click on a spline node, and drag mouse to draw a new shape. Release the mouse to complete the drawing.	Drawing always happens on a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction.</td></tr>
</table>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Tree Properties</h1>
<p>Every tree has a root node, which controls global properties for the tree. This is the least complex group type, but it holds some valuable properties that control the rendering and generation of the entire tree.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Distribution (Tree Root Group)</h2>
<p>Here you can adjust global properties for the tree. Add parts to the tree in the Hierachy View above.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Tree Seed</span></td><td >The global seed for the tree, changing this will affect the entire tree. Use it to randomize your tree, while keeping the general structure of it.</td></tr>
<tr ><td ><span class='doc-prop'>Area Spread</span></td><td >Adjusts the spreading of trunk nodes, only has an effect if you have more than one trunk. Useful if you are creating a small patch of bamboo as an example.</td></tr>
</table>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Geometry (Tree Root Group)</h2>
<p>The geometry tab allows you to modify properties related to the geometric construction of your tree.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr ><td ><span class='doc-prop'>Ambient Occlusion</span></td><td >Select whether you want the editor to compute ambient occlusion for the tree. While changing a tree property ambient occlusion is always hidden, and won't be computed until you finish the changes. Ambient occlusion can greatly improve the visual quality of your tree, but it does take a short while to compute, so you may disable it until you are happy with your tree.</td></tr>
<tr ><td ><span class='doc-prop'>LOD Quality</span></td><td >Defines the level-of-detail for the entire tree. A low value will make the tree less complex, a high value will make the tree more complex. Check the statistics in the hierachy view, to see the current complexity of the mesh. Depending on the type of tree and your target platform you may need to adjust this property, to make the tree fit within your polygon budget. With careful creation of art assets and a little planning you can produce good looking trees 	with relatively few polygons.</td></tr>
</table>
