<p>Just like when using Meshes or Textures, the workflow for <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio File</span> assets is designed to make things work for you quickly and easily.  You can make your Audio Files with any format you like, and Unity can import them and play them back, but there's some specific information you should know for working with Audio Files.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The supported audio formats for Unity executables are <span class='doc-keyword'>Ogg Vorbis</span> and uncompressed audio.  You can choose to convert any Audio File to Ogg Vorbis from inside the <span class='doc-keyword'>Editor</span>.  You can create your audio files in any format you like, and Unity will automatically convert them to Ogg Vorbis.  If you don't, then your audio files will remain uncompressed, and will be much larger in size.  Having uncompressed audio is okay for short sounds, like up to several seconds.  Longer sounds and especially music will have huge file sizes when uncompressed, and will increase the overall size of the executable.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>With this in mind, the general rules of thumb are:
</p><ul><li>Convert music and long sounds to Ogg Vorbis from inside the Editor. The audio data will be small, but will cost CPU cycles to decode at play time. For best sound quality supply your own Ogg Vorbis files, or use uncompressed audio files (converting an <span class='wikiword'>MP3</span> file to Ogg loses some quality).
</li><li>Use uncompressed audio for short sound effects. The audio data will be larger, but sounds won't need to be decoded at play time.
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Any Audio File imported into Unity is called as an <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Clip</span>.  Audio Clips work in conjunction with <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Sources</span> and an <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Listener</span>.  Think of Clips as audio data only.  When you attach your Clip to an object in the game, it becomes an Audio Source and it now has <span class='doc-prop'>Volume</span>, <span class='doc-prop'>Pitch</span>, and other properties like <span class='doc-prop'>Loop</span>.  While a Source is playing, an Audio Listener can "hear" all Sources that are close enough, and those are the sounds you will hear through your speakers.  There can be only one Audio Listener in your scene, and this is usually attached to the <span class='doc-keyword'>Main Camera</span>.  In most cases you will work with Audio Sources more than Clips or Listeners.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>See the <a href="../Manual/Sound.html">Sound chapter</a> in the <a href="../Manual/Creating Gameplay.html">Creating Gameplay</a> section of this manual for more information on using sound in Unity.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Audio Clip</h1>
<div class='specific-no-iphone' > 
<p><span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Clips</span> are used by <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Sources</a> to represent the audio asset imported into Unity.  Unity supports both Mono and Stereo audio assets. Unity supports importing the following audio file formats: <b>.aif</b>, <b>.wav</b>, <b>.mp3</b>, and <b>.ogg</b>.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Importing Audio Assets</h2>
<p>Unity supports both Compressed and Uncompressed Audio.  Any type of file except .mp3 will be initially imported as Uncompressed. <span class='wikiword'>MP3</span> and Compressed audio files must be decompressed by the CPU while the game is running, but are smaller in file size.  Native formats have the benefit of being higher fidelity without increasing CPU taxation, but create much larger files.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>As a general rule of thumb, Compressed audio is best for long files like background music or dialog, and uncompressed is better for short sound effects that are under two seconds.  However...
</p>
<p class='vspace'><b>If you are creating a web player game, you should Compress as much of your audio as possible.</b> This will help you attain the smallest file size for webplayer downloads.  If you tweak the amount of Compression, the difference in sound quality won't be noticeable.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='PositionalAudio' id='PositionalAudio'></a>
</p><h2>Using 3D Audio</h2>
<p>If an audio clip is marked as a <span class='doc-prop'>3D Sound</span> then it will be played back to simulate its position in the game world's 3D space. 3D sounds simulate distance and location of sounds by fading volume and panning across speakers.  Unity supports 3D audio, and any stereo or mono clip can be played back in 3D space.  However, mono 3D sounds are the most common.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='OggPerformance' id='OggPerformance'></a>
</p><h2>Loading Compressed Audio</h2>
<p>Compressed audio files have an option to choose when the Clip will be decompressed.  The option is set in the Import Settings:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr class='tableheader'><td  class='prop'></td><td class='function'></td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Decompress On Load</span> enabled</td><td  align='left'>Decompress and load the Clip into RAM when the player is loading.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Decompress On Load</span> disabled (Live decompression)</td><td  align='left'>Decompress and play the Clip real-time when the Clip is triggered to start.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class='vspace'>Decompressing on load is the most commonly used option, and shouldn't really be disabled unless you have a special case.  It means that the levels containing the Clip will take longer to load initially, and it will use up more of the end-user's RAM.  Live decompression does not load the Clip data into RAM at level load.  Instead, it requires the CPU to decompress the sound real-time.  This means it is more CPU intensive rather than RAM intensive.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To summarize, enable decompression on load as much as possible, and definitely for all short Clips.  Pick live decompression for longer Clips like music tracks.  All Ogg Vorbis Clips using live decompression will increase CPU usage.  It can use a substantial amount of CPU to live decompress multiple Clips at once, so you should avoid playing more than 2 live decompression Clips at once.
