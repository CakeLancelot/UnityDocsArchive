<p>Unity will automatically detect files as they are added to your project folder.  When you put any asset into your project's Assets folder, you will see the asset appear in your Project View within the editor.  The Project View is window into the Assets folder.  When you are building a game and you want to add a new asset of any type, all you have to do is create the asset and save it somewhere in your project's assets folder.  When you return to Unity or launch it, the added file(s) will be detected and imported.
</p>

<p>Additionally, as you update and save your assets, the changes will be detected and the asset will be re-imported in Unity.  This allows you to focus on refining your assets without struggling to make them compatible with Unity.
</p>

<h2>Maintaining Assets</h2>

<p>It is very important to remember to move, rename, and otherwise manipulate your assets from the Project View once they have been imported into Unity.  There are many dependencies that are established behind the scenes, and if you relocate a file or folder from the Finder, the dependencies will be broken and you will have to re-link your assets.  This is a huge headache and you probably don't want to do it.  So just remember to only Save to the Assets folder from the Finder, and never rename or move files from the Finder.  Always use Project View.
</p>

<h2>Asset Types</h2>

<p>There are a handful of basic asset types that will go into your game.  The types are:
</p>

<ul><li> Mesh Files &amp; Animations
</li><li> Texture Files
</li><li> Sound Files
</li></ul>

<p>We'll discuss the details of importing each of these file types and how they are used.
</p>

<h3>Meshes &amp; Animations</h3>

<p>Whichever 3-D package you are using, Unity will import the meshes and animations from each file.  For a list of applications that are supported by Unity, please see <a href="../Manual/HOWTO-importObject.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<p>Your mesh file does not need to have an animation to be imported.  If you do use animations, you have your choice of importing all animations from a single file, or importing separate files each with one animation.  For more information about importing animations, please see <a href="../Manual/Character-Animation.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<p>Once your mesh is imported into Unity, you can drag it to the Scene or Hierarchy to create an instance of it.  You can also add Components to the instance, which will not be attached to mesh file itself.
</p>

<p>Meshes will be imported with UVs and a number of default materials (one material per UV).  You can then assign the appropriate texture files to the materials and complete the look of your mesh in Unity's game engine.
</p>

<h3>Textures</h3>

<p>Unity supports all image formats.  Even when working with layered Photoshop files, they are imported without disturbing the Photoshop format.  This allows you to work with a single texture file for a very care-free and streamlined experience.
</p>

<p>You should make your textures in dimensions that are to the power of two.  E.g. 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, etc.  Simply placing them in your project's Assets folder is sufficient, and they will appear in the Project View.
</p>

<p>Once your texture has been imported, you should assign it to a <a href="../Components/class-Material.html">Material</a>.  The material can then be applied to a mesh, particle system, or GUI Texture.  Using the Import Settings, it can also be converted to a Cubemap or Bumpmap for different types of applications in the game.  For more information about importing textures, please read the <a href="../Components/class-Texture2D.html">Texture Component page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sounds</h3>

<p>Any sounds you want to use in your game should be converted to Ogg Vorbis format before they are imported into Unity.  Unity will support other sound file types like MP3, but they will not be compressed when a build of your game is published.  Using Ogg Vorbis files from the start will keep your player sizes low.
</p>

<p>You can also use WAV files for sounds that are very short, like a machine gun sound.  If your sound is longer than 5 - 10 seconds, you should convert it to Ogg Vorbis.
</p>

<p>Once sound files are imported, they can be attached to any Game Object.  The Game Object will require an <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source Component</a> to use the sound file.
