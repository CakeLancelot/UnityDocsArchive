<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Details</h2>
<p>Rigidbodies allow your <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> to act under control of the physics engine.  This opens the gateway to realistic collisions, varied types of joints, and other very cool behaviors.  Manipulating your <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> by adding forces to a Rigidbody creates a very different feel and look than adjusting the Transform <span class='doc-keyword'>Component</span> directly.  Generally, you shouldn't manipulate the Rigidbody and the Transform of the same <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> - only one or the other.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The biggest difference between manipulating the Transform versus the Rigidbody is the use of forces.  Rigidbodies can receive forces and torque, but Transforms cannot.  Transforms can be translated and rotated, but this is not the same as using physics. You'll notice the distinct difference when you try it for yourself.  Adding forces/torque to the Rigidbody will actually change the object's position and rotation of the Transform component.  This is why you should only be using one or the other.  Changing the Transform while using physics could cause problems with collisions and other calculations.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Rigidbodies must be explicitly added to your <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> before they will be affected by the physics engine.  You can add a Rigidbody to your selected object from <span class='doc-prop'>Components-&gt;Physics-&gt;Rigidbody</span> in the menubar. Now your object is physics-ready; it will fall under gravity and can receive forces via scripting, but you may need to add a <span class='doc-keyword'>Collider</span> or a Joint to get it to behave exactly how you want.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Parenting</h3>
<p>When an object is under physics control, it moves semi-independently of the way its transform parents move. If you move any parents, they will pull the Rigidbody child along with them. However, the Rigidbodies will still fall down due to gravity and react to collision events.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>To control your Rigidbodies, you will primarily use scripts to add forces or torque. You do this by calling <span class='doc-prop'><a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html' rel='nofollow'>AddForce()</a></span> and <span class='doc-prop'><a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddTorque.html' rel='nofollow'>AddTorque()</a></span> on the object's Rigidbody.  Remember that you shouldn't be directly altering the object's Transform when you are using physics.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Animation</h3>
<p>For some situations, mainly creating ragdoll effects, it is neccessary to switch control of the object between animations and physics. For this purpose Rigidbodies can be marked <span class='doc-prop'><a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/Rigidbody-isKinematic.html' rel='nofollow'>isKinematic</a></span>. While the Rigidbody is marked <span class='doc-prop'>isKinematic</span>, it will not be affected by collisions, forces, or any other part of physX. This means that you will have to control the object by manipulating the <a href="../Components/class-Transform.html">Transform</a> component directly.  Kinematic Rigidbodies will affect other objects, but they themselves will not be affected by physics. For example, Joints which are attached to Kinematic objects will constrain any other Rigidbodies attached to them and Kinematic Rigidbodies will affect other Rigidbodies through collisions.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Colliders</h3>
<p>Colliders are another kind of component that must be added alongside the Rigidbody in order to allow collisions to occur.  If two Rigidbodies bump into each other, the physics engine will not calculate a collision unless both objects also have a Collider attached.  Collider-less Rigidbodies will simply pass through each other during physics simulation.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/class-Rigidbody-1.jpg' /><br /><em>Colliders define the physical boundaries of a Rigidbody</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Add a Collider with the <span class='doc-prop'>Component-&gt;Physics</span> menu.  View the Component Reference page of any individual Collider for more specific information:
</p><ul><li><a href="../Components/class-BoxCollider.html">Box Collider</a> - primitive shape of a cube
</li><li><a href="../Components/class-SphereCollider.html">Sphere Collider</a> - primitive shape of a sphere
</li><li><a href="../Components/class-CapsuleCollider.html">Capsule Collider</a> - primitive shape of a capsule
</li><li><a href="../Components/class-MeshCollider.html">Mesh Collider</a> - creates a collider from the object's mesh, cannot collide with another Mesh Collider
</li><li><a href="../Components/class-WheelCollider.html">Wheel Collider</a> - specifically for creating cars or other moving vehicles
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Compound Colliders</h3>
<p>Compound Colliders are combinations of primitive Colliders, collectively acting as a single Collider.  They come in handy when you have a complex mesh to use in collisions but cannot use a <span class='doc-keyword'>Mesh Collider</span>.  To create a Compound Collider, create child objects of your colliding object, then add a primitive Collider to each child object.  This allows you to position, rotate, and scale each Collider easily and independently of one another.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/class-Rigidbody-2.jpg' /><br /><em>A real-world Compound Collider setup</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>In the above picture, the environment has a Mesh Collider attached.  Mesh Colliders work the best for terrain or environments made from irregular shapes. The <span class='doc-menu'>gun_model</span> <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> has a Rigidbody attached, and multiple primitive Colliders as child <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>. When the Rigidbody parent is moved around by forces, the child Colliders move along with it. The primitive Colliders will collide with the environment's Mesh Collider, and the parent Rigidbody will alter the way it moves based on forces being applied to it and how its child Colliders interact with other Colliders in the Scene.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Mesh Colliders can't normally collide with each other.  If a Mesh Collider is marked as <span class='doc-prop'>Convex</span>, then it can collide with another Mesh Collider.  The typical solution is to use primitive Colliders for any objects that move, and Mesh Colliders for static background objects.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Use the right size</h2>
<p>The size of the your <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>'s mesh is much more important than the mass of the Rigidbody.  If you find that your Rigidbody is not behaving exactly how you expect - it moves slowly, floats, or doesn't collide correctly - consider adjusting the scale of your mesh asset.  Unity's default unit scale is 1 unit = 1 meter, so the scale of your imported mesh is maintained, and applied to physics calculations.  For example, a crumbling skyscraper is going to fall apart very differently than a tower made of toy blocks, so objects of different sizes should be modeled to accurate scale.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you are modeling a human make sure he is around 2 meters tall in Unity. To check if your object has the right size compare it to the default cube. You can create a cube using <span class='doc-menu'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>-&gt;Create Other-&gt;Cube</span>. The cube's height will be exactly 1 meter, so your human should be twice as tall.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you aren't able to adjust the mesh itself, you can change the uniform scale of a particular mesh asset by selecting it in <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span> and choosing <span class='doc-menu'>Assets-&gt;Import Settings...</span> from the menubar.  Here, you can change the scale and re-import your mesh.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If your game requires that your <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> needs to be instantiated at different scales, it is okay to adjust the values of your Transform's scale axes.  The downside is that the physics simulation must do more work at the time the object is instantiated, and could cause a performance drop in your game.  This isn't a terrible loss, but it is not as efficient as finalizing your scale with the other two options.  Also keep in mind that non-uniform scales can create undesirable behaviors when Parenting is used.  For these reasons it is always optimal to create your object at the correct scale in your modeling application.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Hints</h2>
<ul><li>The relative <span class='doc-prop'>Mass</span> of two Rigidbodies determines how they react when they collide with each other.
</li><li>Making one Rigidbody have greater <span class='doc-prop'>Mass</span> than another does not make it fall faster in free fall. Use <span class='doc-prop'>Drag</span> for that.
</li><li>A low <span class='doc-prop'>Drag</span> value makes an object seem heavy. A high one makes it seem light. Typical values for <span class='doc-prop'>Drag</span> are between .001 (solid block of metal) and 10 (feather).
</li><li>If you are directly manipulating the Transform component of your object but still want physics, attach a Rigidbody and make it Kinematic.
</li><li>If you are moving a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> through its Transform component but you want to receive Collision/Trigger messages, you must attach a Rigidbody to the object that is moving.
