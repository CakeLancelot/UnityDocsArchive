<p>Unity Remote is a software application that makes your iPhone act as a remote control for your project in Unity iPhone. This is useful for rapid development when you don't want to compile and deploy your project to iPhone for each change and prefer to use the Editor Game window instead.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The Apple iPhone Simulator is not supported in Unity iPhone as it does not benefit performance critical applications such as games. Use Unity iPhone Remote application instead.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>How to use the Unity Remote</h2>
<p>In your Unity iPhone installation, you will find a folder called "Unity Remote". This contains an <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project that you'll launch from <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> and build to install the Unity Remote onto your device. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Assuming you've already created the provisioning profile, and successfully installed iPhone apps on your device, you just need to double-click the <span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span>.xcodeproj in the <span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span> folder of your Unity iPhone install directory. This will launch <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> where you then click "Build and Go". The app should then be installed to your iPhone.  If you have never built and run applications before we strongly recommend that you consider building some of the Apple examples first to familiarize yourself with <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> and the iPhone.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Once it is installed, make sure your device is connected via Wi-Fi to the same network as your development machine. Launch the Unity Remote on your iPhone while Unity is running on your computer, and select your computer from the list that appears. Now, whenever you enter Play mode in the Editor, your device will act as a remote control that you use for developing and testing your game. You'll be able to control the application with the iPhone wirelessly. You'll also see a low-res version of the app on the iPhone itself. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2><span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> shows strange errors while deploying Unity Remote to the device</h2>
<p>The default Identifier in the Unity Remote project is not compatbile with your provisioning profile. You will have to manually alter this Identifier in your <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project. This Identifier has to match your provisioning profile. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you have a provisioned <span class='wikiword'>AppID</span> with an asterisk on the end (e.g. ######.com.mycompany.*) already, you can skip the rest of this paragraph. If you don't have created <span class='wikiword'>AppID</span> with an trailing asterisk, then you will have to create one in the Program Portal on Apple's iPhone Developer Program. Go to Program Portal, choose <span class='wikiword'>AppIDs</span> tab, click Add ID button (in the top right corner) and type your usual bundle identifier followed by dot and asterisk (e.g. com.mycompany.*) in the App ID (Bundle Seed ID + Bundle Identifier) field. Add new <span class='wikiword'>AppID</span> to you provisioning profile, download and reinstall it. Don't forget to restart your <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> afterwards. If you have any troubles consult <a class='urllink' href='http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/provisioningprofiles/howto.action' rel='nofollow'>Provisioning How-to section</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/unity-remote-0.jpg' /><br /><em>Don't forget to change the Identifier before you can install the Unity Remote on your device</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Open Unity Remote project with <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span>. In the menu select <b>Project-&gt;Edit Active Target "Unity Remote"</b>, that will open new window titled Target "Unity Remote" Info. Select Properties tab. Change Identifier property field from <b>com.unity3d.<span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span></b> to <b>bundle identifier</b> in your <span class='wikiword'>AppID</span> followed by "<b>.</b>" (dot) followed by "<b><span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span></b>". For example if your provisioning profile contains ######.com.mycompany.* <span class='wikiword'>AppID</span>, then change Identifier field to <b>com.mycompany.<span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span></b>. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Now select <b>Build-&gt;Clean all targets</b> in the menu, then compile and install Unity Remote again. You may also need to change Active SDK from Simulator to Device - 2.0 | Release. It is OK to select SDK 2.0 even if your device runs newer OS version.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Poor graphics quality when running game in <span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span></h2>
<p>When developing game with <span class='wikiword'>UnityRemote</span> the game actually runs on your Mac and its visual content is heavily compressed and streamed to the device. As a result you see a low-res version of the app on the iPhone. How the game actually runs on device could be tested by launching <span class='doc-prop'>Build &amp; Run</span> from the Editor menu (<span class='doc-menu'>File-&gt;Build Settings-&gt;Build &amp; Run</span>).
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Unity Remote is laggy</h2>
<p>Performance of Unity Remote strongly depends on your Wi-Fi speed, quality of your networking hardware and another side factors. For the best experience create an Ad-Hoc network between your Mac and iPhone. Just click the Airport icon on your Mac and chose "Create network", then enter a name/password and eventually click OK. On your iPhone, choose Settings-&gt;Wi-Fi and select the new Wi-Fi network you have just created.  Remember that an ad-hoc network is really a wireless connection that does not involve a wireless access point.  Typically using ad-hoc networking you will have no access to the internet.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Also, turning Bluetooth off both on your iPhone and on Mac should improve connection quality.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>If Unity Remote does not see your Mac</h2>
<ul><li>Check if Unity Remote and your Mac are connected to the same wireless network. 
</li><li>Check your Firewall's settings, router's security settings and any other hardware and software that may filter packets on your network.
</li><li>Leave Unity Remote running and turn off your Mac's Airport for a minute or two, then turn in on again.
</li><li>Restart both Unity and the Unity Remote. Sometimes you also need to cold-restart iPhone (hold menu and power buttons).
</li><li>Unity Remote uses Apple Bonjour service, so check if your Mac has it turned on.
</li><li>Reinstall Unity Remote from the latest Unity iPhone package.
</li></ul>
