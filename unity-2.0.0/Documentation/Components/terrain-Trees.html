<p>Unity's Terrain Engine has special support for Trees.  You can put thousands of trees onto a Terrain, and render them in-game with a practical frame rate.  This works by rendering trees near the camera in full 3D, and transitioning far-away trees to 2D billboards.  Billboards in the distance will automatically update to orient themselves correctly as they are viewed from different angles.  This transition system makes a detailed tree environment very simple for performance.  You have complete control over tweaking the parameters of the mesh-to-billboard transition so you can get the best performance you need.

<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-0.jpg' /><br /><em>You can easily paint lots of trees for beautiful environments like this</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Adding Trees</h2>
<p>Select the <span class='doc-keyword'>Place Trees</span> button <img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-1.jpg' /> in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Inspector</span>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Before you can place trees on your terrain, you have to add them to the library of available trees.  To do this, click the <span class='doc-menu'>Edit Trees button-&gt;Add Tree</span>.  You'll see the <span class='doc-keyword'>Add Tree</span> dialog appear.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-2.jpg' /><br /><em>The Add Tree dialog</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Select the tree from your <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span> and drag it to the <span class='doc-prop'>Tree</span> variable.  You can also edit the <span class='doc-prop'>Bend Factor</span> if you want to add an additional bit of animated "bending in the wind" effect to the trees.  When you're ready, click <span class='doc-menu'>Add</span>.  The tree will now appear selected in the Inspector.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-3.jpg' /><br /><em>The newly added tree appears selected in the Inspector</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>You can add as many trees as you like.  Each one will be selectable in the Inspector for you to place on your Terrain.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-4.jpg' /><br /><em>The currently selected tree will always be highlighted in orange</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Painting Trees</h2>
<p>While still using the Place Trees tool, click anywhere on the Terrain to place your trees.  To erase trees, hold the <span class='doc-menu'>Shift</span> button and click on the Terrain.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-5.jpg' /><br /><em>Painting trees is as easy as using a paintbrush tool</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>There are a number of options at your disposal when placing trees.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr class='tableheader'><td  class='prop'></td><td class='function'></td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Brush Size</span></td><td  align='left'>Radius in meters of the tree placing brush.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Tree Spacing</span></td><td  align='left'>Percentage of tree width between trees.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'>Color Variation</span></td><td  align='left'>Allowed amount of color difference between each tree.</td></tr>

<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Tree Painting Tips</h3>
<div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-6.jpg' /><br /><em>Different Brush sizes cover different area sizes</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-7.jpg' /><br /><em>Adjust <span class='doc-prop'>Tree Spacing</span> to change the density of the trees you're painting</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Editing Trees</h2>
<p>To change any import parameters for an added tree, select the detail and choose <span class='doc-menu'>Edit Trees button-&gt;Edit Detail</span>.  Or double-click the tree you want to edit.  You will then see the <span class='doc-keyword'>Edit Tree</span> dialog, and you can change any of the settings.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Mass Placement</h2>
<p>If you don't want to paint your trees and you just want a whole forest created, you can use <span class='doc-menu'>Terrain-&gt;Mass Place Trees</span>.  Here, you will see the <span class='doc-keyword'>Mass Place Trees</span> dialog.  You can set the number of trees you want placed, and they'll be instantly positioned.  All the trees added to your Terrain will be used in this mass placement.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-8.jpg' /><br /><em>10,000 Trees placed at once</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Refreshing Source Assets</h2>
<p>If you make any updates to your tree asset source file, it must be manually re-imported into the Terrain.  To do this, use <span class='doc-menu'>Terrain-&gt;Refresh Tree and Detail Prototypes</span>.  This is done after you've changed your source asset and saved it, and will refresh the trees in your Terrain immediately.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Creating Trees</h2>
<p>Every tree should consist of a single mesh with two <span class='doc-keyword'>Materials</span>. One for the trunk and one for the leaves. For performance reasons, triangle count should be kept below 2000 for an average tree. The fewer triangles the better.  The pivot point of the tree mesh must be exactly at the root of the tree, that is at the point where the tree should meet the surface it is placed on. This makes it the easiest to import into Unity and other modelling applications.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Trees must use the <span class='doc-prop'>Nature/Soft Occlusion Leaves</span> and <span class='doc-prop'>Nature/Soft Occlusion Bark shader</span>.  In order to use those shaders you also have to place the tree in a special folder that contains the name "Ambient-Occlusion". When you place a model in that folder and reimport it, Unity will calculate soft ambient occlusion specialized for trees. The "Nature/Soft Occlusion" shaders need this information. If you don't follow the naming conventions the tree will look weird with completely black parts.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Unity also ships with several high quality trees in the "Terrain Demo.unitypackage". You can use those trees readily in your game. Even if you don't want to use the builtin trees, we strongly recommend that you take a look at those trees as an example on how to model trees. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Using Low Poly Trees</h2>
<div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/terrain-Trees-9.jpg' /></div>
<p class='vspace'>One branch with leaves is done with only six triangles and shows quite a bit of curvature. You can add more triangles for even more curvature. But the main point is: When making trees, work with triangles not with quads. If you use quads you basically need twice as many triangles to get the same curvature on branches.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The tree itself wastes a lot of fillrate by having large polygons but almost everything is invisible due to the alpha. This should be avoided for performance reasons and of course because the goal is to make dense trees. This is one of the things that makes Oblivion's trees look great. They are so dense you cant even see through the leaves.
