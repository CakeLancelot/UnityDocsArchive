<p>Textures bring your meshes, particles, and interfaces to life! They are image or movie files that you lay over or wrap around your objects. As they are so important, they have a lot of properties. If reading this for the first time, jump down to <i>Details</i>, and return to the actual settings when you need a reference.
</p>

<p>Which shaders you use for your objects put specific requirements on your textures, but the basic principle is that you can put any image file inside your project. If it meets the size requirements (specified below), it will get imported and optimized for game use.
</p>

<p>This extends to multi-layer Photoshop or TIFF files - they are flattened on import, so there is no size penalty for your game.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The texture inspector looks a bit different from most others:
</p>

<p><img class='figure' src='images/Textures-0.jpg' />
</p>

<p>The top section contains a few settings, and the bottom part contains a texture preview. The changes you make to the bottom part only affect the display, and not the texture itself.
</p>

<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Filtering Mode</nobr></b></td><td> Selects how the texture is filtered when it gets stretched by 3D transformations.

<dl><dt>No Filtering</dt><dd> The texture becomes blocky up close</dd><dt>Bilinear</dt><dd> The texture becomes blurry up close</dd><dt>Trilinear</dt><dd> Like Bilinear, but the texture also blurs between the different mip levels...</dd></dl>

</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Anisotropy</nobr></b></td><td>   Increases texture quality when viewing the texture at a steep angle. Good for floor textures

<dl><dt>Repeat</dt><dd> The texture repeats (tiles) itself.</dd><dt>Clamp</dt><dd>  The texture's edges get stretched. </dd></dl>

<p></td></tr></tr></table>
</p>

<h2>Import Settings</h2>

<p>Textures all come from image files in your project folder. How they are imported is specified by the texture's import settings. You change these by selecting the file texture in the project window and clicking the import settings button on the toolbar above:
</p>

<p><img class='figure' src='images/Textures-1.jpg' />
</p>

<p>This brings up the import settings dialog:
</p>

<p><img class='figure' src='images/Textures-2.jpg' />
</p>

<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Max. Texture Size</nobr></b></td><td> The maximum imported texture size. A lot of artists prefer to work with huge textures - scale the texture down to a suitable size with this.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Texture Format</nobr></b></td><td> What internal representation is used for the texture. This is a tradeoff between size and quality. In the examples below we show the final size of a in-game texture of 256 by 256 pixels.

At 256 KB for a 256x256 texture, this one is expensive. Most of the time, <b>DXT5</b> offers sufficient quality at a much smaller size.

By default, Box mode is selected. If your textures are to blurry in the distance, try some of the other options and see if they work. This is not an exact science, so play around and see what works for different textures.

<h2> Details</h2>

<h3> Supported Formats</h3>
<p>Unity can read the following file formats: PSD, TIFF, JPG, TGA, GIF, PNG,  BMP, IFF, PICT. It should be noted that Unity can import multi-layer PSD &amp; TIFF files just fine. They are flattened automatically on import but the layers are maintained in the assets themselves, so you don't lose any of your work when using these file types natively. This is important as it allows you to just have one copy of your textures that you can use from Photoshop, through your 3D modelling app and into Unity.
</p>

<h3> Texture Sizes</h3>
<p>Ideally texture sizes should be powers of two on the sides. These sizes are as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 pixels. The textures do not have to be square, i.e. width can be different from height.
</p>

<p>It is possible to use other (non power of two) texture sizes with Unity. Non power of two texture sizes work best when used on <a href="../Components/class-GuiTexture.html">GUI Textures</a>, however if used on anything else they will be converted to an uncompressed RGBA 32 bit format. That means they will take up more video memory (compared to DXT compressed textures) and will be slightly slower to load. In general you'll use non power of two sizes only for making GUI.
</p>

<p>Non power of two texture assets can be scaled up at import time using a <i>Scale NonPower2 Sizes Up</i> option in the import settings. Then Unity will scale texture contents up to the next power of two, and in the game they will behave just like any other texture. So they can still be compressed and very fast to load.
</p>

<h3> UV Mapping</h3>
<p>When mapping a 2D texture on to a 3D model, some sort of wrapping is done. This is called UV mapping and is done in your 3D modelling app. Inside Unity, you can scale and move the texture using <a href="../Components/class-Material.html">Materials</a>. Scaling bump &amp; detail maps are especially useful
</p>

<h3> Mip Maps</h3>
<p>Mip Maps are a list of progressively smaller versions of an image, used optimise performance on real-time 3D engines. Object that are far away from the camera use the smaller textures. Using mip maps uses 33% more memory, but not using mipmaps can be a huge performance loss. You should always you mipmaps for in-game textures; the only exceptions are textures that will never be minified (e.g. GUI textures).
</p>

<h3> Bump Maps</h3>
<p>Bump maps are used by bump map shaders to make low-polygon models look as if they contain more detail. Unity uses normal maps encoded as RGB images. You also have the option to generate a normal map from a grayscale height map image.
</p>

<h3> Detail Maps</h3>
<p>If you want to do a terrain, you normally use your main texture to show where there are grass, rocks sand, etc... If your terrain has a decent size, you will end up with a very blurry terrain. <a href="../Manual/HOWTO-UseDetailTexture.html">Detail textures</a> hide this fact by fading in small details as your main texture get up close.
</p>

<p>When drawing detail textures, a neutral gray is invisible, white makes the main texture twice as bright and black makes the main texture completely black.
</p>

<h3> Cube Maps</h3>
<p>If you want to use texture for reflection maps (e.g. use <i>Reflective</i> builtin shaders), you need to use <a href="../Components/class-CubemapTexture.html">Cubemap Textures</a>.
</p>

<h3> Light Cookies</h3>
<p>An interesting way to add a lot of visual detail to your scenes is to use cookies - greyscale textures you use to control the precise look of in-game lighting. This is fantastic for making moving clouds and giving an impression of dense foilage. The <a href="../Components/class-Light.html">Light</a> page has more info on all this, but the main thing is that for textures to be usable for cookies, the following properties need to be set:
</p>

<p>For <i>spotlight</i> cookies, use the following settings:
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Texture Format</nobr></b></td><td> Any setting that has an alpha channel</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Build Alpha from RGB Grayscale</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Generate Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Border Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr></tr></table>
You should keep the edges of you cookie texture solid black in order to get the proper effect. In the texture inspector, set the Edge Mode to <b>Clamp</b>.
</p>

<p>For <i>directional</i> lights, use the following settings:
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Texture Format</nobr></b></td><td> Any setting that has an alpha channel</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Build Alpha from RGB Grayscale</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Generate Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Border Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Disabled
</td></tr></tr></table>
This texture will tile, so in the texture inspector, you must set the Edge Mode to <b>Repeat</b>.
</p>

<p>For <i>point</i> lights, you need to use <b>Cube Maps</b>. To generate one, either make six textures and assign them as detailed in <a href="../Components/class-CubemapTexture.html">Cubemap Textures</a> or generate on with the following settings:
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Texture Format</nobr></b></td><td> Any setting that has an alpha channel</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Generate Cube Map</nobr></b></td><td> Any other setting than <b>None</b>.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Build Alpha from RGB Grayscale</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Generate Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Enabled
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Border Mip Maps</nobr></b></td><td> Disabled
</td></tr></tr></table>
