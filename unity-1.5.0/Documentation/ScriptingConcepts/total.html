<p><h2>Layers</h2>

<p>Layers are most commonly used by Cameras to render only a part of the scene, and by Lights to illuminate only parts of the scene.
But they can also used by raycasting to selectively ignore colliders.
</p>

<h3>Creating Layers</h3>

<p>The first step is to create a new layer, which we can then assign to a game object.
To create a new layer, open the Edit menu and select Project Settings -&gt; Tags.
</p>

<p>We create a new layer in one of the empty User Layers. We choose layer 8.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/Layers-0.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/Layers-0.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<h3>Assigning Layers</h3>

<p>Now that you have created a new layer. You have to assign the layer to one of the game objects.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/Layers-1.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/Layers-1.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>In the tag manager we assigned the Player layer to be in layer 8.
</p>

<h3>Drawing only a part of the scene with the camera's culling mask</h3>

<p>Using the camera's culling mask, you can selectively render objects which are in one particular layer.
To do this, select the camera that should selectively render objects.
</p>

<p>Modify the culling mask by checking or unchecking layers in the culling mask property.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/Layers-2.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/Layers-2.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<h3>Casting Rays Selectively</h3>

<p>Using layers you can cast rays and ignore colliders in specific layers.
For example you might want to cast a ray only against the player layer and ignore all other colliders.
</p>

<p>The Physics.Raycast function takes a bitmask, where each bit determines if a layer will be ignored or not.
If all bits in the layerMask are on, we will collide against all colliders.
If the layerMask = 0, we will never find any collisions with the ray.
</p>

<p><pre class='codelisting'>
// bit shift the index of the layer to get a bit mask
var layerMask = 1 &lt;&lt; 8;
// Does the ray intersect any objects which are in the player layer.
if (Physics.Raycast (transform.position, Vector3.forward, Mathf.Infinity, layer))
  print (&quot;The ray hit the player&quot;);
</pre>
</p>

<p>In the real world you want to the inverse of that however. We want to cast a ray against all colliders except those in the player layer.
<pre class='codelisting'>
function Update ()
{
  // Bit shift the index of the layer (8) to get a bit mask
  var layerMask = 1 &lt;&lt; 8;
  // This would cast rays only against colliders in layer 8.
  // But instead we want to collide against everything except layer 8. The ~ operator does this, it inverts a bitmask.
  layerMask = ~layerMask;

  var hit : RaycastHit;
  // Does the ray intersect any objects excluding the player layer
  if (Physics.Raycast (transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward), hit, Mathf.Infinity, layerMask))
  {
    Debug.DrawRay (transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward) * hit.distance, Color.yellow);
    print (&quot;Did Hit&quot;);
  }
  else
  {
    Debug.DrawRay (transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward) *1000, Color.white);
    print (&quot;Did not Hit&quot;);
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>When you don't pass a layerMask to the Raycast function, it will only ignore colliders that use the IgnoreRaycast layer.
This is the easiest way to ignore some colliders when casting a ray.
</p>



<p>When Rigidbodies fall to rest - a box landing on the floor - they will start sleeping. Sleeping is an optimization which allows the Physics Engine to stop processing those rigidbodies. This way you can have a huge amount of rigidbodies in your scene as long as you make sure that they normally don't move.
</p>

<p>Rigidbody sleeping happens completely automatic. Whenever a rigidbody is slower than the the sleepAngularVelocity and sleepVelocity it will start falling asleep, after a few frames of resting it will then be set to sleep. When the body is sleeping, no collision detection or simulation will be performed anymore. This saves a lot of cpu cycles.
</p>

<p>Rigidbodies are also automatically awoken when:
another rigidbody collides with the sleeping rigidbody
another rigidbody connected to through a joint is moving.
when modifying a property of the rigidbody
when <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#AddForce">adding forces</a>.
</p>

<p>Thus if you want to make rigidbodies fall to rest, don't modify their properties or add forces when they are about to fall to rest.
</p>


<p>There are two variables that you can tune to make sure your rigidbodies automatically fall to rest.
</p>

<p><a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">Rigidbody.sleepVelocity</a> and <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">Rigidbody.sleepAngularVelocity</a>. Those two variables are initialized to the sleepVelocity and sleepAngularVelocity variable defined in the Physics Manager (Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Physics)
</p>

<p>Rigidbodies can also be forced to sleep using <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">rigidbody.Sleep</a>.
This is useful to make rigidbodies already rest when loading a new level.
</p>



<p>If you have a sleeping rigidbody and you move a static collider (A collider without a Rigidbody attached) into the rigidbody or pull it from underneath the rigidbody, the sleeping rigidbody will not awake.
If you move a Kinematic Rigidbody out from underneath normal Rigidbodies that are at rest on top of it, the sleeping Rigidbodies will &quot;wake up&quot; and be correctly calculated again in the physics update.  So if you have a lot of Static Colliders that you want to move around and have different object fall on them correctly, use Kinematic Rigidbody Colliders.
</p>


<p>Kinematic rigidbodies that That is, they will not be calculated during the physics update since they are not going anywhere.  If you move a Kinematic Rigidbody out from underneath normal Rigidbodies that are at rest on top of it, the sleeping Rigidbodies will &quot;wake up&quot; and be correctly calculated again in the physics update.  So if you have a lot of Static Colliders that you want to move around and have different object fall on them correctly, use Kinematic Rigidbody Colliders.
