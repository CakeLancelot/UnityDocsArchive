# UnityDocsArchive
This is a collection of documentation for older versions of Unity3D that are no longer available on their website (3.5.0 and below). 

For 3.5.1 and newer, [see this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/ManualVersions.html).

## Something missing?
I was only able to extract the documentation from dmg files that are publicly available via download.unity3d.com. If you have documentation or an installer for a version that is missing, please open an issue or pull request so that it can be added.
