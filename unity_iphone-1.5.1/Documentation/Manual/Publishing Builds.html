<p>At any time while you are creating your game, you might want to see how it looks when you build and run it outside of the editor as a standalone or web player.  This section will explain how to access the <span class='doc-keyword'>Build Settings</span> and how to create different builds of your games.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><span class='doc-menu'>File-&gt;Build Settings...</span> is the menu item to access the Build Settings window.  It pops up an editable list of the scenes that will be included when you build your game.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='specific-iphone' > 
<div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Publishing Builds-0.jpg' /><br /><em>The Build Settings window</em></div>
</div>
<p class='vspace'>The first time you view this window in a project, it will appear blank.  If you build your game while this list is blank, only the currently open scene will be included in the build.  If you want to quickly build a test player with only one scene file, just build a player with a blank scene list.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It is easy to add scene files to the list for multi-scene builds.  There are two ways to add them.  The first way is to click the <span class='doc-menu'>Add Current</span> button.  You will see the currently open scene appear in the list.  The second way to add scene files is to drag them from the <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span> to the list.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>At this point, notice that each of your scenes has a different index value.  <span class='doc-keyword'>Scene 0</span> is the first scene that will be loaded when you build the game.  When you want to load a new scene, use <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/Application.LoadLevel.html' rel='nofollow'>Application.LoadLevel()</a> inside your scripts.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you've added more than one scene file and want to rearrange them, simply click and drag the scenes on the list above or below others until you have them in the desired order.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you want to remove a scene from the list, click to highlight the scene and press <span class='doc-menu'>Command-Delete</span>.  The scene will disappear from the list and will not be included in the build.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>When you are ready to publish your build, select a <span class='doc-keyword'>Build target</span> and press the <span class='doc-menu'>Build</span> button. You will be able to select a name and location for the game using a standard Save dialog. When you click <span class='doc-menu'>Save</span>, Unity builds your game pronto. It's that simple. If you are unsure where to save your built game to, consider saving it into the projects root folder.  You cannot save the build into the Assets folder.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='specific-iphone' > 
<p>Enabling the <span class='doc-keyword'>Compress Textures</span> checkbox will compress all the textures in your project when it is built. You only need to compress a texture once, but the first time you perform the compression it could take a few minutes. When you update assets after compressing them, they will need to be re-compressed the next time you build a player.  Alternatively, you can enable texture compression upon import from the <span class='doc-menu'>Unity-&gt;Preferences</span> menu.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Enabling the <span class='doc-keyword'>Strip Debug Symbols</span> checkbox will remove debugging information from the built player.  This will reduce the file size of the published game so it's optmimal for completed games. Alphas or betas should have this option disbled for debugging purposes.  Your final release should always have this checkbox enabled.
</p></div>

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Building standalone players</h2>
<p>With Unity you can build standalone applications for Windows and Mac (Intel, <span class='wikiword'>PowerPC</span> or Universal, which runs on both architectures). It's simply a matter of choosing the build target in the build settings dialog, and hitting the 'Build' button.
When building standalone players, the resulting files will vary depending on the build target. On Windows an executable file (.exe) will be built, along with a Data folder which contains all the resources for your application. On Mac an app bundle will be built, containing the file needed to run the application, as well as the resources.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Distributing your standalone on Mac is just to provide the app bundle (everything is packed in there). On Windows you need to provide both the .exe file and the Data folder for others to run it. Think of it like this: Other people must have the same files on their computer, as the resulting files that Unity builds for you, in order to run your game.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Inside the build process</h2>
<p>The building process will place a blank copy of the built game application wherever you specify. Then it will work through the scene list in the build settings, open them in the editor one at a time, optimize them, and integrate them into the application package. It will also calculate all the assets that are required by the included scenes and store that data in a separate file within the application package.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>Any <span class='doc-keyword'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span></span> in a scene that is tagged with '<span class='wikiword'>EditorOnly</span>' will be not be included in the published build. This is useful for debugging scripts that don't need to be included in the final game.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>When a new level loads, all the objects in the previous level are destroyed. To prevent this, use <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/Object.DontDestroyOnLoad.html' rel='nofollow'>DontDestroyOnLoad()</a> on any objects you don't want destroyed. This is most commonly used for keeping music playing while loading a level, or for game controller scripts which keep game state and progress.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>After the loading of a new level is finished, the message: <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnLevelWasLoaded.html' rel='nofollow'>OnLevelWasLoaded()</a> will be sent to all active game objects.
</li></ul>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='specific-iphone' > 
<h2>Inside the iPhone build process</h2>
<p>The iPhone application build process is a two step process: 
</p><ol><li><span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project is generated with all the required libraries, precompiled .NET code and serialized assets.
</li><li><span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project is built and deployed on the actual device.
</li></ol><p class='vspace'>When "Build" is hit on "Build settings" dialog only the first step is accomplished. Hitting "Build and Run" performs both steps.
If in the project save dialog the user selects an already existing folder an alert is displayed. Currently there are two <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project generation modes to select: 
</p><ul><li><span class='doc-prop'>replace</span> - all the files from target folder are removed and the new content is generated
</li><li><span class='doc-prop'>append</span> - the "Data", "Libraries" and project root folder are cleaned and filled with newly generated content. The <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project file is updated according to the latest Unity project changes. <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> project "Classes" subfolder could be considered as safe place to place custom native code, but making regular backups is recommended. Append mode is supported only for the existing <span class='wikiword'>XCode</span> projects generated with the same Unity iPhone version.
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>If Cmd+B is hit then the automatic build and run process is invoked and the latest used folder is assumed as the build target. In this case <span class='doc-prop'>append</span> mode is assumed as default. 
</p></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Preloading</h2>
<p>Published builds automatically preload all assets in a scene when the scene loads. The exception to this rule is scene 0. This is because the first scene is usually a splashscreen, which you want to display as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To make sure all your content is preloaded, you can create an empty scene which calls <span class='doc-prop'><span class='wikiword'>Application.LoadLevel</span>(1)</span><span class='specific-iphone'> after one frame</span>. In the build settings make this empty scene's index 0. All subsequent levels will be preloaded.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>You're ready to build games</h2>
<p>By now, you have learned how to use Unity's interface, how to use assets, how to create scenes, and how to publish your builds. There is nothing stopping you from creating the game of your dreams. You'll certainly learn much more along the way, and we're here to help.
