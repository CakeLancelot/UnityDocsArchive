<p>At any time while you are building your game, you might want to see how it looks when you build and run it outside of the editor as a real game.  This section will explain how to access the Build Settings and how to create different builds of your games.
</p>

<p><b>File -> Build Settings...</b> is the menu item to access the build Build Settings window.  It pops up an editable list of the scenes in your soon-to-be-built game.  Using this list, you add and rearrange any <b>.unity</b> scene files that will be included in the game build.
</p>

<p><img class='figure' src='images/Publishing Builds-0.jpg' />
</p>

<p><i>The Build Settings window</i>
</p>

<p>Don't panic if your scene list is blank.  It is easy to add scene files to the list.  There are two ways to add them.  The first way is to click the <b>Add Open Scene</b> button.  You will see the current scene appear in the list.  The second way to add scene files is to click &amp; drag them from the Project View to the list.
</p>

<p>At this point, notice that each of your scenes has a different index value.  Scene 0 is the first scene that will be loaded when you build the game.  When you want to load a new scene, use <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Application.LoadLevel.html">Application.LoadLevel()</a> inside your scripts.
</p>

<p>If you've added more than one scene file and want to rearrange them, simply click and drag the scenes on the list above or below others until you have them all in the right order.
</p>

<p>If you want to remove a scene from the list, click to highlight the scene and press <b>Command-Delete</b>.  The scene will disappear from the list.
</p>

<p>When you are ready to publish your build, select a build target platform and press the Build button. You will be able to select a name and location for the game. When you click Save, Unity builds your game pronto.  It's that simple.
</p>

<p>If you want to quickly build a test player with only one scene file, you can build a player with a blank scene list. In this case, Unity just includes the scene that is currently open.
</p>

<p>Enabling the <b>Compress Textures</b> checkbox will compress all the textures in your project when it is built.  You only need to compress a texture once, but the first time you perform the compression it could take a few minutes.  When you update assets after compressing them, they will need to be re-compressed next time you build a player.  Alternatively, you can enable texture compression upon import from the <b>Unity -> Preferences</b> menu.
</p>

<p>Enabling the <b>Strip Debug Symbols</b> checkbox will remove debugging information from the built player.  This will reduce the filesize.  For any future build, you can re-enable this if you need to.  Your final release should always have this checkbox enabled.
</p>

<h2> Inside the process</h2>

<p><b>Note:</b> this is not necessary to read, but could be helpful to understand. The building process will place a blank copy of the built game application wherever you specify. Then it will work through the scene list in the build settings, open them in the editor one at a time, optimize them, and integrate them into the application package. It will also calculate all the assets that are required by the included scenes and stores that data in a seperate file within the application package.
</p>

<ul><li>Any game object in a scene that is tagged with 'EditorOnly' will be not be included in the published build. This is useful for debugging scripts that you don't want to include in the final game.
</li></ul>

<ul><li>When a new level loads, all the objects in the previous level are destroyed. To prevent this, use <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Object.DontDestroyOnLoad.html">DontDestroyOnLoad()</a> on any objects you don't want destroyed.  This is most commonly used to keeping music playing while loading a level, or for game controller scripts which keep game state and progress.
</li></ul>

<ul><li>After the loading of a new level is finished, the message: <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnLevelWasLoaded.html">OnLevelWasLoaded()</a> will be sent to all active game objects.
</li></ul>

<ul><li>For more information on how to best create a game with multiple scenes, for instance a main menu, a high-score screen, or actual game levels, see the Scripting Tutorial.pdf
</li></ul>

<h2>Preloading</h2>

<p>Published builds automatically preload all assets in a scene when the scene loads.  The exception to this rule is scene 0. This is because the first scene is usually a splashscreen, which you want to display as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>To make sure all your content is preloaded, you can create an empty scene which calls Application.LoadLevel(1). In the build settings make this empty scene's index 0. All subsequent levels will be preloaded.
</p>

<h2>You're ready to build games</h2>

<p>By now, you have learned how to use Unity's interface, how to use assets, how to create scenes, and how to publish your builds.  There is nothing stopping you from creating the game of your dreams.  You'll probably learn lots more along the way, and we're here to help.
</p>

<p>To learn more details about using Unity itself, you can <a href="../Manual/Building Scenes.html">continue reading the manual</a> or follow the <a href="../Manual/Tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>.
