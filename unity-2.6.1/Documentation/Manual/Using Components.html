<p><span class='doc-keyword'>Components</span> are the nuts &amp; bolts of objects and behaviors in a game.  They are the functional pieces of every <span class='doc-keyword'>GameObject</span>.  If you don't yet understand the relationship between Components and GameObjects, we recommend that you read the <a href="../Manual/GameObjects.html">GameObjects</a> page before going any further.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A GameObject is a container for many different Components.  By default, all GameObjects automatically have a <span class='doc-prop'>Transform</span> Component.  This is because the Transform dictates where the GameObject is located, and how it is rotated and scaled.  Without a Transform Component, the GameObject wouldn't have a location in the world.  Try creating an empty GameObject now as an example.  Click the <span class='doc-menu'>GameObject-&gt;Create Empty</span> menu item.  Select the new GameObject, and look at the <span class='doc-keyword'>Inspector</span>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Components-0.jpg' /></div>
<p><em>Even empty GameObjects have a Transform Component</em>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Remember that you can always use the Inspector to see which Components are attached to the selected GameObject.  As Components are added and removed, the Inspector will always show you which ones are currently attached.  You will use the Inspector to change all the properties of any Component (including scripts)
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Adding Components</h2>
<p>You can add Components to the selected GameObject through the Components menu.  We'll try this now by adding a <span class='doc-keyword'>Rigidbody</span> to the empty GameObject we just created.  Select it and choose <span class='doc-menu'>Component-&gt;Physics-&gt;Rigidbody</span> from the menu.  When you do, you will see the Rigidbody's properties appear in the Inspector.  If you press <span class='doc-keyword'>Play</span> while the empty GameObject is still selected, you might get a little surprise.  Try it and notice how the Rigidbody has added functionality to the otherwise empty GameObject.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Components-1.jpg' /></div>
<p><em>An empty GameObject with a Rigidbody Component attached</em>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>You can attach any number or combination of Components to a single GameObject.  Some Components work best in combination with others.  For example, the Rigidbody works with any Collider.  The Rigidbody controls the Transform through the <span class='doc-keyword'>Ageia PhysX</span> physics engine, and the Collider allows the Rigidbody to collide and interact with other Colliders.  A different example of Component combinations is a <span class='doc-keyword'>Particle System</span>.  They use a <span class='doc-keyword'>Particle Emitter</span>, <span class='doc-keyword'>Particle Animator</span>, and <span class='doc-keyword'>Particle Renderer</span> to create a group of moving particles.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you want to know more about using a particular Component, you can read about any of them in the <a href="../Components/Components.html">Component Reference</a>.  You can also access the reference page for a Component from Unity by clicking on the small <b>?</b> on the Component's header in the Inspector.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Editing Components</h2>
<p>One of the great aspects of Components is flexibility.  When you attach a Component to a GameObject, there are different values or 
<span class='doc-keyword'>Properties</span> in the Component that can be adjusted in the editor while building a game, or by scripts when running the game.  There are two main types of Properties: <span class='doc-keyword'>Values</span> and <span class='doc-keyword'>References</span>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Look at the image below.  It is an empty GameObject with an <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> Component.  All the values of the <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> in the Inspector are the default values.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Components-2.jpg' /></div>
<p class='vspace'>This Component contains a single Reference property, and seven Value properties.  <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span> is the Reference property.  When this Audio Source begins playing, it will attempt to play the audio file that is referenced in the <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span> property.  If no reference is made, an error will occur because there is no audio to be played.  You must reference the file within the Inspector.  This is as easy as dragging an audio file from the Project View onto the Reference Property.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Components-3.jpg' /></div>
<p><em>Now a sound effect file is referenced in the <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span> property</em>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Components can include references to any other type of Component, file, or GameObject.  For any of these, you just need to drag &amp; drop the appropriate reference to the property.  This type of referencing is very quick and powerful, especially when using scripting.  <span class='specific-no-iphone'>To learn more about using scripts and properties, please view the Scripting Tutorial on the <a href="../Manual/Tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> page.</span>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The seven remaining properties on the Audio Clip are all Value properties.  These can all be adjusted simply by clicking on them and pressing the Enter key.  You can then enter any value you like using the keyboard, and press Enter to save the value.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>You can also option- or right-click and drag on numeric properties to scroll values quickly
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>The Value properties on the Audio Clip are all numeric, but some properties can be strings as well.  For example, the <span class='doc-prop'>Text Mesh</span> Component contains a <span class='doc-prop'>Text</span> property, which accepts alphanumeric characters.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Using Components-4.jpg' /></div>
<p><em>Some values can contain text, like the <span class='doc-prop'>Text</span> property in the Text Mesh Component</em>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Testing out Properties</h3>
<p>While your game is in <span class='doc-keyword'>Play Mode</span>, you are free to change properties in any GameObject's Inspector.  For example, you might want to experiment with different heights of jumping.  If you create a <span class='doc-prop'>Jump Height</span> property in a script, you can enter Play Mode, change the value, and press the jump button to see what happens.  Then without exiting Play Mode you can change it again and see the results within seconds.  When you exit Play Mode, your properties will revert to their pre-Play Mode values, so you don't lose any work.  This workflow gives you incredible power to experiment, adjust, and refine your gameplay without investing a lot of time in iteration cycles.  Try it out with any property in Play Mode.  We think you'll be impressed.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Removing Components</h2>
<p>If you want to remove a Component, option- or right-click on its header in the Inspector, and choose <span class='doc-menu'>Remove Component</span>.  Or you can left-click the options icon next to the <b>?</b> on the Component header.  All the property values will be lost and this cannot be undone, so be completely sure you want to remove the Component before you do.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>The Component-Script Relationship</h2>
<p>Although <span class='doc-keyword'>Scripts</span> seem very different from Components at first, the truth is that a script is a type of Component.  Basically, it is a Component that you are creating yourself.  You will define its members to be exposed in the Inspector, and it will execute whatever functionality you've written.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Scripting Components</h3>
<p>There are many Components that can be directly accessed in any script.  For example, if you want to access the <span class='doc-prop'>Translate</span> function of the Transform component, you can just write <span class='doc-prop'>transform.Translate()</span> or <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject.transform.Translate()</span>.  This works because all scripts are attached to a GameObject.  So when you write <span class='doc-prop'>transform</span> you are implicitly accessing the Transform Component of the GameObject that is being scripted.  To be explicit, you write <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject.transform</span>.  There is no advantage in one method over the other, it's all a matter of preference for the scripter.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To see a list of all the Components you can access implicitly, take a look at the <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/GameObject.html' rel='nofollow'>GameObject</a> page in the <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/index.html' rel='nofollow'>Scripting Reference</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Using <span class='doc-prop'>GetComponent()</span></h3>
<p>There are many Components which are not enabled as members of the <span class='doc-prop'>GameObject</span> class.  So you cannot access them implicitly, you have to access them explicitly.  You do this by calling the <span class='doc-prop'>GetComponent("component name")</span> and storing a reference to the result.  This is most common when you want to make a reference to another script attached to the GameObject.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Pretend you are writing <em>Script B</em> and you want to make a reference to <em>Script A</em>, which is attached to the same GameObject.  You would have to use <span class='doc-prop'>GetComponent()</span> to make this reference.  In Script B, you would simply write:
</p>
<p class='vspace'><span class='doc-prop'>scriptA = GetComponent("ScriptA");</span>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Then you would be able access any of the Script A variables by writing <span class='doc-prop'>scriptA.variableName</span> within Script B.  For more help with using <span class='doc-prop'>GetComponent()</span>, take a look at the <a class='urllink' href='../ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html' rel='nofollow'>GetComponent() Script Reference page</a>.
