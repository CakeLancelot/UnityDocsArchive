<p><span class='doc-keyword'><span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span></span> are the most important objects in Unity.  It is very important to understand what a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> is, and how it can be used.  This page will explain all that for you.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>What are <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>?</h2>
<p>Every object in your game is a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.  However, <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> don't do anything on their own.  They need special properties before they can become a character, an environment, or a special effect.  But every one of these objects does so many different things.  If every object is a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>, how do we differentiate an interactive power-up object from a static room?  What makes these <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> different from each other?
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The answer to this question is that <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> are containers.  They are empty boxes which can hold the different pieces that make up a lightmapped island or a physics-driven car.  So to really understand <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>, you have to understand these pieces; they are called <span class='doc-keyword'>Components</span>.  Depending on what kind of object you want to create, you will add different combinations of Components to the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.  Think of a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> as an empty cooking pot, and Components as different ingredients that make up your recipe of gameplay.  You can read more about Components <a href="../Manual/Using Components.html">here</a>, but we recommend you finish reading this page first.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='Relationship' id='Relationship'></a>
</p><h2>The <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>-Component Relationship</h2>
<p>We now know that a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> contains Components.  We'll explore this relationship by discussing the most common Component -- the <span class='doc-prop'>Transform</span> Component.  With any Unity Scene open, create a new <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> (using <span class='doc-menu'>Shift-Control-N</span> on Windows or <span class='doc-menu'>Shift-Command-N</span> on Mac), select it and take a look at the <span class='doc-keyword'>Inspector</span>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/GameObjects-0.jpg' /><br /><em>The Inspector of an Empty <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span></em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Notice that an empty <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> still contains a Name, a <a href="../Components/Tags.html">Tag</a>, and a <a href="../Components/Layers.html">Layer</a>. Every <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> also contains a <a href="../Components/class-Transform.html">Transform Component</a>. It is impossible to create a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> in Unity without a Transform Component. All of the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>'s Transform properties are enabled by its use of the Transform Component.  The Transform Component just happens to be critical to all <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>, so each <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> has one. But <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> can contain other Components as well.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='specific-no-iphone' > 
<div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/GameObjects-1.jpg' /><br /><em>The Main Camera, added to each scene by default</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Taking a look at the Main Camera <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>, we can see that it contains a different collection of Components.  Specifically, a <a href="../Components/class-Camera.html">Camera Component</a>, a <a href="../Components/class-GUILayer.html">GUILayer</a>, a <a href="../Components/class-FlareLayer.html">Flare Layer</a>, and an <a href="../Components/class-AudioListener.html">Audio Listener</a>.  All of these Components provide additional functionality to the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.  Without them, there would be nothing rendering the graphics of the game for the person playing!  Rigidbodies, Colliders, Particles, and Audio are all different Components (or combinations thereof) that can be added to any given <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.
</p></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>The Transform Component</h3>
<p>The Transform Component is one of the most important Components.  It defines the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>'s position, rotation, and scale in the game world/Scene View.  If a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> did not have a Transform Component, it would be nothing more than some information in the computer's memory.  It effectively would not exist in the world.  The Transform Component also enables a concept called <span class='doc-keyword'>Parenting</span>, which is utilized through the <span class='doc-keyword'>Unity Editor</span> and is a critical part of working with <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>. If you would like to learn more about the Transform Component and Parenting, please read the <a href="../Components/class-Transform.html">Transform Component Reference page</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>The <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>-Script Relationship</h2>
<p>When you create a <span class='doc-keyword'>script</span> and and attach it to a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>, the script appears in the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>'s Inspector just like a Component.  This is because scripts become Components when they are saved.  In technical terms, a script compiles as a type of Component, and is treated like any other Component by the Unity engine.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Any public variables you declare in your script will appear editable or linkable in the Inspector of their <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.  When you are writing a script, you can directly access any member of the <span class='doc-prop'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span></span> class.  You can see a list of all the <span class='doc-prop'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span></span> class members <a href="../Components/class-GameObject.html">here</a>.  If any of the indicated classes are attached to the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> as a Component, you can access that Component directly through the script by simply typing the member name.  For example, typing <span class='doc-prop'>transform</span> is equivalent to <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject.transform</span>.  The <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject</span> is assumed by the compiler, unless you specifically reference a different <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Typing <span class='doc-prop'>this</span> will be accessing the script Component that you are writing.  Typing <span class='doc-prop'>this.gameObject</span> is referring to the <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> that the script is attached to.  You can access the same <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> by simply typing <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject</span>.  Logically, typing <span class='doc-prop'>this.transform</span> is the same as typing <span class='doc-prop'>transform</span>.  If you want to access a Component that is not included as a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> member, you have to use <span class='doc-prop'>gameObject.<span class='wikiword'>GetComponent</span>()</span> which is explained on the next page.
