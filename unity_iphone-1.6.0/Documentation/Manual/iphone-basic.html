<p>This section covers the most common and important questions that come up when starting to work with the iPhone.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>I've just received iPhone Developer approval from Apple, but I've never developed for the iPhone before.  What do I do first?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: Download the SDK, get up and running on the Apple developer site, set up your team, devices, and provisioning. We've provided a <a href="../Manual/iphone-accountsetup.html">basic list of steps</a> to get you started.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Should Unity-built games run in the iPhone Simulator?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: No. The iPhone simulator is not very useful for Unity because it does not simulate all inputs from the iPhone and because it does not emulate performance you get on the iPhone. You test out gameplay directly inside Unity using the iPhone as a remote control while it's running the Unity Remote application. Then when you're ready to test performance and optimize the game, you publish to the iPhone.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Unity Features</h2>
<h3>How do I work with the touch screen and accelerometer?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: In the scripting reference inside your Unity iPhone installation, you will find some classes called iPhoneInput, along with iPhoneSettings and a few others.  These new iPhone-specific classes provide the hooks into the device's functionality that you need to build your games. Consult <a href="../Manual/iphone-Input.html">page on iPhone Input System</a> for more information.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Does the iPhone support Unity's Terrain Engine?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: Terrains are not currently supported in Unity iPhone. You need extremely low poly rendering for terrains on the iPhone. The terrain system is not made for that and you can do much better by doing extremely low poly terrains.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>My existing particle systems seem to run really slowly on the iPhone.  What should I do?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: iPhone has relatively low fillrate. If your particles cover rather large portion of the screen with multiple layers - it will kill iPhone performance even with the simplest shader. We suggest baking your particle effects into a series of textures off-line. Then at run-time you can use 1-2 particles to display them via animated textures. You can get pretty good looking effects with minimum of overdraw this way.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Can I make a game that uses heavy physics?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>:  Physics are pretty expensive on the iPhone, and we recommend you use them as little as possible. Physics does a lot of floating point number crunching which is not ideal for the iPhone's ARM processor. Completely avoid MeshColliders if at all possible, but they can be used if they are necessary. To improve performance,  use a low Fixed framerate using <span class='doc-menu'>Edit-&gt;Time-&gt;Fixed Delta Time</span>. A framerate of 10-30 is recommended. Enable rigidbody interpolation to achieve smooth motion while using low physics frame rates. In order to achieve completely fluid framerate without oscillations, it is best to pick fixed deltaTime value based on the average framerate your game is getting on the iPhone. Either 1:1 or half the frame rate is recommended. For example if you get 30 fps, you should use 15 or 30 fps for fixed frame rate (0.033 or 0.066)
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Can I access the gallery, music library or the native iPod player in Unity iPhone?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: Yes - if you code it. Unity iPhone with the Advanced license supports the native plugin system, where you can add any feature you need, including access to Gallery, Music library, iPod Player and any other feature that the iPhone SDK exposes. Unity iPhone does not provide an API for accessing the listed features' through Unity scripts.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>UnityGUI Considerations</h2>
<h3>What kind of performance impact will UnityGUI make on my games?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: UnityGUI is fairly expensive when many controls are used.  It is ideal to limit your use of UnityGUI to game menus, or very minimal GUI Controls while your game is running.  It's important to note that every object that has a script with an OnGUI() call will require additional processor time, even if it is an empty OnGUI() block.  It is best to disable any scripts that have an OnGUI() call if the GUI Controls are not being used.  You can do this by marking the script as <code>enabled = false</code>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Any other tips for using UnityGUI?</h3>
<p>Try using GUILayout as little as possible. If you are not using GUILayout at all from one OnGUI call, you can disable all GUILayout rendering using <code>MonoBehaviour.useGUILayout = false;</code> This doubles GUI rendering performance. Finally, use as few GUI elements while rendering 3D scenes as possible.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Device Graphical Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Can I use bumpmapped objects in Unity iPhone?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: iPhone is somewhere between TNT2 and the original GeForce in fragment processing capabilities. It can add or multiply two textures together, but normal mapping is simply not supported.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>What are some basic vertex count guidelines?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: To achieve 30 fps on the iPhone, you should keep per frame visible vertex count below 7000. That does not limit how many vertices you should have per scene. As long as you can ensure that you never have more than 7000 vertices <b>visible</b> at one time you, can guarantee a consistent high framerate. Take advantage of the new occlusion culling feature to ensure you stay in the 7000 vertices target.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>General Performance </h2>
<h3>How I can improve application startup time on iPhone?</h3>
<p>Application startup time one device is determined by your application binary size and first scene size. Application binary size can be improved by minimizing script dependencies and enabling stripping (Advanced license feature). More details on how to optimize binary size can be found <a href="../Manual/iphone-playerSizeOptimization.html">here</a>. User experience sometimes could be improved by adding small first scene that just shows some logo and then starts loading real scene. Scene size could be reduces by <a href="../Manual/Reducing File size.html">optimizing assets</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>When running on iPhone my game framerate is bad. How I can improve it?</h3>
<p>Your game framerate could be affected by many causes. It could be too complex geometry, use of OnGUI elements during gameplay, sub optimal scripts, too many .NET object allocations, etc. First step towards optimization is to identify your performance bottlenecks. <a href="../Manual/iphone-InternalProfiler.html">Internal profiler</a> is a tool that can help you. Next step is to make actual optimizations, you can read more about it <a href="../Manual/iphone-performance.html">here</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Xcode</h2>
<h3>I am getting a lot of compiler errors in Xcode.  What's going on?</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: Make sure that you have selected the "Device" mode and not "Simulator" from Project-&gt;Set Active SDK in the menubar.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Sometimes when I click "Build and Go", I see strange errors.</h3>
<p><b>A</b>: This is a bug in Xcode, and is non-destructive to your project.  Simply click OK to bypass the message, and your game should function completely normally.
