<p>You use lights to illuminate your scenes - everything from the sun, to light from explosions are made with light components. Three basic light type exist:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>Point lights</i> shine from a location equally in all directions, like a light bulb.
</li><li> <i>Directional lights</i> are placed infinitely far away and affect everything in the scene, like the sun.
</li><li> <i>Spot lights</i> shine from a point in a direction and only illuminate objects within a cone - like the headlights of a car.
</li></ul>

</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Unity supports 3 basic lighting types, with a lot of variation possible.
</p>

<p>You can assign a texture to be projected from any of these light types. This is known as a cookie. The cookie must supply an alpha mask that modulates the light amount. They are a great way af adding lots of complexity to a scene, and hence providing a lot of atmosphere.
</p>

<h3>Point Lights</h3>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-1.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-1.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>Point lights shine out from a point in all directions. They are the most common lights in computer games - typically used for explosions, light bulbs, etc.
</p>

<p>Cookies must be cubemaps with an alpha channel. This cubemap gets projected out in all directions.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-2.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-2.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>


<h3>Spot Lights</h3>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-3.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-3.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>Spot lights only shine in one direction, in a cone.
</p>

<p>The cookie is projected down the cone of the spot light. This is good for light-through windows style effects. It is very important that the texture is black at the edges and its wrapping mode is set to <i>clamp</i>. For more info on this, see <a href="../Components/class-FileTexture.html">Texture</a>
</p>


<h3>Directional Lights</h3>
<p>Directional lights are used mainly in outdoor scenes for sun &amp; moonlight.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-4.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-4.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>With a directional light, the cookie is projected down the center of the light's Z axis. If you want to stretch it out over a large area, set the wrapping mode to 'repeat'
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-5.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-5.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>The above is a great way to add some quick detail to large outdoor scenes. You can even slide the light slowly over the scene to give the impression of moving clouds.
</p>

<p>A complete description of the component, including:
</p>
<ul><li> Spot lights are most expensive, directional cheap, point lights in between
</li></ul>


<h3>Performance considerations</h3>
<p>Lights can be rendered by two basic methods: Per-vertex lit and per-pixel lit. Vertex lighting only calculates the lighting at the vertrices of the game models, and interpolates the lighting over the surfaces of the models. Per-pixel lights are calculated at every screen pixel, and hence are much more expensive.
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/class-Light-6.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/class-Light-6.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>Lights have a big impact on rendering speed - therefore a tradeoff has to be made betwen lighting quality and game speed. Since per-pixel lights are much more expensive than per-vertex lights, Unity will only render The brightest lights at per-pixel quality. The actual number of lights can be set as a property in the <a href="../Components/comp-LightManager.html">Light Manager</a>. Which lights are birghtest is determined on an object-by-object case. This means:
</p>
<ul><li> Huge objects will only get a few lights applied at high quality. If the player is far from these, local lights will be done at low quality. Hence, it is better to split huge objects up in a couple of small ones.
</li></ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p><ul><li>
Spotlights with textures can be extremely effective for making light coming in from windows. In this case, disable attenuation, and set the range to just reach the floor.
</li><li>Low-intensity point lights are good for providing depth to a scene.
</li><li>Put a light near a particle system and assign a 'lighted' shader from the Particles group to its material. This works really well with projection textures.
</li><li>For high performance, use the <i>Vertex Lit</i> shader. This shader only does per-vertex lighting, giving a much higher throughput on low-end cards.
</li></ul>
