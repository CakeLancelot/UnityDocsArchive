<p>Unity has the next-generation Novodex physics engine built-in. This allows for unique emergent behaviour and is generally very cool.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>To put an object under physics control, simply add a Rigidbody to it. When you do this, the object will be affected by gravity, colliding and hitting other objects in the world.
</p>

<h2>Collider objects</h2>
<p>In order for an object to be considered for collisions, you need to add collider components to them. You use colliders to set up the physical shape of the object.
</p>

<p>You also use colliders to make triggers. These execute scripted code whenever objects hit them.
</p>

<h2>Joints</h2>
<p>You use joints to attach physics-controlled objects together. Use them to add hinges to objects and make connect wheels to cars, etc.
</p>


<h1>Rigidbody</h1>
<p>Rigidbody components take control over an object's position - it makes the objects fall down under the influence of gravity, and can calculate how objects will respond to collisions.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Mass</nobr></b></td><td> The weight of the object. Keep this below 1 for the best stability.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Drag</nobr></b></td><td> How much the object is slowed down from air resistance. 0 means not at all, whereas infinity makes the object stop immediately.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Angular Drag</nobr></b></td><td> How fast the object's rotation is slowed down. 0 means not at all, whereas infinity makes the object stop immediately.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Use Gravity</nobr></b></td><td> If on, the object is affected by gravity.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Is Kinematic</nobr></b></td><td> If on the object will not be driven by the physics engine. This is useful for moving platforms or if you want to animate an rigidbody that has an hinge attached.
<p></td></tr></tr></table>
</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Rigidbodies provide a key ingredient for making your world come alive, simulating lots of physical behaviour and providing lots of quick emergent behaviours.
</p>

<p>You move objects under physics control about by adding forces to them, rather than by setting the position of the objects. While cumbersome, this is important in order to ensure the stability of the physics system. Adding forces prevents objects accidentally moving into walls and ensures that the physics system can handle collision response in a sensible manner.
</p>

<h3> Colliders</h3>
<p>In order for objects to collide correctly, they need to have colliders attached. Colliders come in two flavours: Mesh Colliders and Collision Primitives.
</p>

<p>Mesh colliders are the easiest to use - simply add a MeshCollider to an object to make othe objects bounce of it. When importing a mesh you can also enable the Has Mesh Collider option in the import settings.
</p>

<p>Collision primitives are the basic shapes of <a href="../Components/class-SphereCollider.html">spheres</a>, <a href="../Components/class-BoxCollider.html">boxes</a> and <a href="../Components/class-CapsuleCollider.html">capsules</a>.
</p>

<h3>Compound colliders</h3>
<p>You add multiple colliders to a rigidbody by adding collision objects as transform children of the rigidbody object. Look at the example below:
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/Physics-0.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/Physics-0.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>

<p>The terrain has a Mesh Collider attached, as you cannot capture its irregular shape using collision primitives. The Rigidbody (shown in the sceneview with the transform handles) has 3 children: the capsule, the cube and the sphere. When playing, the rigidbody lands on the terrain, balancing on the 3 collision primitives.
</p>

<p>There is a catch to all this, though: Meshes can't collide with each other, so the typical solution is to use primitives for any objects that move, and meshes for static background objects.
</p>

<h3> Parenting</h3>
<p>When an object is under physics control, it moves semi-independantly of the way its transform parents move. If you move any parents, they will pull the physics object along with them. However, the physically controlled objects still fall down due to gravity and tumble when they hit cliff sides, etc.
</p>

<h3> Scripting</h3>
<p>When objects are under physics control, you mainly control them from scripts. You do this by calling AddForce and AddTorque on the object's rigidbody, rather than setting the position or rotation on its transform.
</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>For ragdoll effects it is important to be able to switch between a characer being animated or simulated by physics.
For this purpose rigidbodies can be marked as kinematic. This means the rigidbody is not affected by collisions or force applied to it. Any motion or rotation has to be set directly by changing the position or rotation of the transform through scripting or by animating it.
Kinematic rigidbodies do affect other objects. Joints which are attached to kinematic actors will constrain any other rigid bodies attached to them. Also kinematic rigidbodies will affect other rigidbodies through collisions.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p><ul><li>
The relative masses of two objects determines how they react when they collide.
</li><li>Making one object have higher mass than another does not make it fall faster in free fall. Use drag for that.
</li><li>A low drag value makes an object seem heavy. A high one makes it seem light. Typical values for drag are between .001 (solid block of metal) and 10 (feather)
</li></ul>
</p>
<h1>Constant Force</h1>
<p>The Constant Force component is a quick utility for adding constant forces to a rigidbody.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Force</nobr></b></td><td> The vector of a force to be applied in world space.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Relative Force</nobr></b></td><td> The vector of a force to be applied in the objects local space.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Torque</nobr></b></td><td> The vector of a torque, applied in world space. The object will begin spinning <i>around</i> this vector. The longer the vector is, the faster the rotation.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Relative Torque</nobr></b></td><td> The vector of a torque, applied in local space. The object will begin spinning <i>around</i> this vector. The longer the vector is, the faster the rotation.
<p></td></tr></tr></table>
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p><ul><li>
To make an object flow upwards, add a constant force with the Force property having a positive Y value.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
To make an object fly forwards,  add a constant force with the Relative Force property having a positive Z value.
</li></ul>
</p>

<h1>Sphere Collider</h1>
<p>A sphere shaped collider.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<table class="reftable"><tr><th>Property:</th><th>Function:</th></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>
Material</nobr></b></td><td> Pointer to the <a href="../Components/class-PhysicMaterial.html">PhysicMaterial</a> used how this collider interacts with others.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Is Trigger</nobr></b></td><td> If enabled, this collider is used for triggering events, and is ignored by the physics system.

</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Radius</nobr></b></td><td> The size of the collider.
</td></tr><tr><td><b><nobr>Center</nobr></b></td><td> The position of the collider in the object's local space.
<p></td></tr></tr></table>
</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This is the simplest collider - it is great for falling boulders, etc...
</p>

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem name="/Library/doc-figure.lbi" src="%22images/Physics-1.jpg%22" --><p><table><tr><td><img class="figure" src="images/Physics-1.jpg"></td></tr></table></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
</p>


<p>Colliders attach themselves to a rigidbody either in the same object as themseleves, or above them in the transform hierarchy. This is called <i>attached</i>. If there is no rigidbody above them, they are considered <i>world colliders</i> and will move with the object they are a part of.
</p>

<p>World Colliders do not collide with each other. For two objects to collide, one of them <i>must</i> have a <a href="../Components/class-Rigidbody.html">Rigid Body</a> attached to it.
</p>

<h3>Triggers</h3>
<p>If a collider is a trigger (has the IsTrigger property checked), whenever it is involved in a collision, a <b>CollisionEvent</b> is sent out to objects attached to it. Triggers do not deflect other physical objects.
</p>

<p>Be aware that for two triggers to collide, one of them must be attached to a rigid body. For a trigger to collide with a collider, one of them must be attached to a rigid body.
</p>


<h2>Hints</h2>
<p><ul><li>
</p>

<p>The colliders do their best to match the scale of an object. If you have a non-uniform scale (a scale which is different in each direction), only the Mesh collider can match completely. You can look at the gizmos in the sceneview to see how Unity has matched.
</p>

<p></li><li>If you make an explosion, it can be very effective to add a rigidbody with lots of drag and a sphere collider to it in order to push it out a bit from the wall it hits.
</li></ul>
</p>

</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>The Mesh Collider takes the assigned LodMesh and places it its object's position and scales it correctly.
</p>


<h2>Hints</h2>
<p><ul><li>
Mesh Colliders are great for background gemoetry.
</li><li>Since Mesh Colliders can't collide with each other, the recommended solution is to use Mesh Colliders for background objects and primitive colliders for objects under physics control.
</li><li>If you attach a Mesh collider to a GameObject with a Mesh assigned, it will autoconfigure to be correct.

</p>

<p>Friction is the quantity which prevents surfaces from sliding off each other. This value is critical when trying to stack objects.
Friction comes in two forms, dynamic and static. Static friction is used when the object is lying still. It will prevent the object from starting to move. If a large enough force is applied to the object it will start moving. At this point dynamic friction will come into play. Dynamic friction will now attempt to slow down the object while in contact with another.
