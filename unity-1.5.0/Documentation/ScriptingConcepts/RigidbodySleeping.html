<p>When Rigidbodies fall to rest - a box landing on the floor - they will start sleeping. Sleeping is an optimization which allows the Physics Engine to stop processing those rigidbodies. This way you can have a huge amount of rigidbodies in your scene as long as you make sure that they normally don't move.
</p>

<p>Rigidbody sleeping happens completely automatic. Whenever a rigidbody is slower than the the sleepAngularVelocity and sleepVelocity it will start falling asleep, after a few frames of resting it will then be set to sleep. When the body is sleeping, no collision detection or simulation will be performed anymore. This saves a lot of cpu cycles.
</p>

<p>Rigidbodies are also automatically awoken when:
another rigidbody collides with the sleeping rigidbody
another rigidbody connected to through a joint is moving.
when modifying a property of the rigidbody
when <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#AddForce">adding forces</a>.
</p>

<p>Thus if you want to make rigidbodies fall to rest, don't modify their properties or add forces when they are about to fall to rest.
</p>


<p>There are two variables that you can tune to make sure your rigidbodies automatically fall to rest.
</p>

<p><a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">Rigidbody.sleepVelocity</a> and <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">Rigidbody.sleepAngularVelocity</a>. Those two variables are initialized to the sleepVelocity and sleepAngularVelocity variable defined in the Physics Manager (Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Physics)
</p>

<p>Rigidbodies can also be forced to sleep using <a class="wiki"  href="../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html#Sleep">rigidbody.Sleep</a>.
This is useful to make rigidbodies already rest when loading a new level.
</p>



<p>If you have a sleeping rigidbody and you move a static collider (A collider without a Rigidbody attached) into the rigidbody or pull it from underneath the rigidbody, the sleeping rigidbody will not awake.
If you move a Kinematic Rigidbody out from underneath normal Rigidbodies that are at rest on top of it, the sleeping Rigidbodies will &quot;wake up&quot; and be correctly calculated again in the physics update.  So if you have a lot of Static Colliders that you want to move around and have different object fall on them correctly, use Kinematic Rigidbody Colliders.
</p>


<p>Kinematic rigidbodies that That is, they will not be calculated during the physics update since they are not going anywhere.  If you move a Kinematic Rigidbody out from underneath normal Rigidbodies that are at rest on top of it, the sleeping Rigidbodies will &quot;wake up&quot; and be correctly calculated again in the physics update.  So if you have a lot of Static Colliders that you want to move around and have different object fall on them correctly, use Kinematic Rigidbody Colliders.
