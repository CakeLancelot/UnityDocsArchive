<p>Just like when using Meshes or Textures, the workflow for <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio File</span> assets is designed to make things work for you quickly and easily.  You can make your Audio Files with any format you like, and Unity can import them and play them back, but there's some specific information you should know for working with Audio Files.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The supported audio formats for Unity executables are <span class='doc-keyword'>Ogg Vorbis</span> and uncompressed audio.  You can choose to convert any Audio File to Ogg Vorbis from inside the <span class='doc-keyword'>Editor</span>.  You can create your audio files in any format you like, and Unity will automatically convert them to Ogg Vorbis.  If you don't, then your audio files will remain uncompressed, and will be much larger in size.  Having uncompressed audio is okay for short sounds, like up to several seconds.  Longer sounds and especially music will have huge file sizes when uncompressed, and will increase the overall size of the executable.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>With this in mind, the general rules of thumb are:
</p><ul><li>Convert music and long sounds to Ogg Vorbis from inside the Editor. The audio data will be small, but will cost CPU cycles to decode at play time. For best sound quality supply your own Ogg Vorbis files, or use uncompressed audio files (converting an <span class='wikiword'>MP3</span> file to Ogg loses some quality).
</li><li>Use uncompressed audio for short sound effects. The audio data will be larger, but sounds won't need to be decoded at play time.
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Any Audio File imported into Unity is called as an <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Clip</span>.  Audio Clips work in conjunction with <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Sources</span> and an <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Listener</span>.  Think of Clips as audio data only.  When you attach your Clip to an object in the game, it becomes an Audio Source and it now has <span class='doc-prop'>Volume</span>, <span class='doc-prop'>Pitch</span>, and other properties like <span class='doc-prop'>Loop</span>.  While a Source is playing, an Audio Listener can "hear" all Sources that are close enough, and those are the sounds you will hear through your speakers.  There can be only one Audio Listener in your scene, and this is usually attached to the <span class='doc-keyword'>Main Camera</span>.  In most cases you will work with Audio Sources more than Clips or Listeners.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>See the <a href="../Manual/Sound.html">Sound chapter</a> in the <a href="../Manual/Creating Gameplay.html">Creating Gameplay</a> section of this manual for more information on using sound in Unity.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Audio Clip</h1>

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Importing Audio Assets</h2>
<p>Unity features support for two types of audio: <span class='doc-keyword'>Uncompressed Audio</span> or <span class='doc-keyword'>Ogg Vorbis</span>.  Any type of audio file you import into your project will be converted to one of these formats.

</p><h3>Import Settings</h3>
<p>If you are importing a file that is not already compressed as Ogg Vorbis, you have a number of options in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Import Settings</span> of the Audio Clip.  To access the Import Settings, select the Audio Clip in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span> and choose <span class='doc-menu'>Assets-&gt;Import Settings...</span> from the menu bar, or click the <span class='doc-menu'>Settings</span> button in the Project View header. Here, you can compress the Clip into Ogg Vorbis format, force it into Mono or Stereo playback, and tweak other options.  There are positives and negatives for both Ogg Vorbis and uncompressed audio.  Each has its own ideal usage scenarios, and you generally should not use either one exclusively.

<p class='vspace'><a name='PositionalAudio' id='PositionalAudio'></a>
</p><h2>Using Positional Audio</h2>
<p>Positional audio is the placement and volume of sounds across the computer speakers.  It simulates distance and location of sounds by fading volume and panning across speakers.  Unity supports Positional audio, but only mono Audio Clips are played positionally.  Stereo sounds are always at the volume and panning determined by the asset file.  For this reason, mono Clips are best for sound effects, and stereo Clips are best for music.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>There are special cases, like if you wanted music playing from two unique in-game speaker environment objects.  The closer you move your character to one of the speakers, the louder the music will get.  This setup would require the speaker music in mono format.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you have an Audio Clip that is in stereo, but you want to use it positionally, change the <span class='doc-prop'>Channels</span> property to <span class='doc-prop'>Force Mono</span> in the Import Settings.  This allows you to be very creative with how you use audio in your game.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='UsingUncompressedAudio' id='UsingUncompressedAudio'></a>
</p><h2>When to use Uncompressed Audio</h2>
<p><b>If you are creating a web player game, do not use uncompressed audio.  Only use Ogg Vorbis.</b>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Uncompressed has the benefit of being quick to play without increasing CPU taxation.  This is because it does not need to be decompressed before it can be played.  However, uncompressed audio is quite large so it will increase the size of your player.  Usually short Clips like sound effects are good for uncompressed audio, unless you are publishing a web player.  If you are publishing a web player, you don't want to increase the file size any more than is absolutely necessary so you basically won't use uncompressed audio, unless you have a few crucial sounds that are shorter than 0.5 seconds.  Clips that Uncompressed audio should usually be either 22khz or 11khz. Ideally you should not use 44khz since that takes up too much disk space and the quality difference is not very audible.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='UsingOggVorbis' id='UsingOggVorbis'></a>
</p><h2>When to use Ogg Vorbis</h2>
<p><b>If you are creating a web player game, always use Ogg Vorbis.</b>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Ogg Vorbis files have the benefit of being compressed, which minimizes the amount of disk space they consume.  This means that you can include long audio files without making a huge increase in the file size of your player.  However, before they can be played back they must be decompressed.  This takes time and processor cycles.  Frequency of Ogg Vorbis files should be 44khz, because playback will be faster than files with a 22khz frequency.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='OggPerformance' id='OggPerformance'></a>
</p><h3>Loading Ogg Vorbis files</h3>
<p>If you're using Ogg Vorbis, you have an option to choose when the Clip will be decompressed.  The option is set in the Import Settings:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><table width='100%'><tr class='tableheader'><td  class='prop'></td><td class='function'></td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'><span class='wikiword'>DecompressOnLoad</span></span> enabled</td><td  align='left'>Decompress and load the Clip into RAM when the player is loading.</td></tr>
<tr ><td  align='left'><span class='doc-prop'><span class='wikiword'>DecompressOnLoad</span></span> disabled (Live decompression)</td><td  align='left'>Decompress and play the Clip real-time when the Clip is triggered to start.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class='vspace'>Decompressing on load is the most common.  It means that the levels containing the Clip will take longer to load initially, and it will use up more of the end-user's RAM.  Live decompression does not load the Clip data into RAM at level load.  Instead, it requires the CPU to decompress the sound real-time.  This means it is more CPU intensive rather than RAM intensive.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To summarize, enable decompression on load as much as possible, and definitely for all short Clips.  Pick live decompression for longer Clips like music tracks.  All Ogg Vorbis Clips using live decompression will increase CPU usage.  It can use a substantial amount of CPU to live decompress multiple Clips at once, so you should avoid playing more than 2 live decompression Clips at once.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h1>Hints</h1>
<ul><li>There is not much of a reason to import your own .ogg files.  Create your sounds in AIFF or WAV format, then you can compress them if you want to right inside the Import Settings.
</li><li>Stereo sounds are always played as-is. If you want to use attenuation and other 3D audio effects, force your Clip to be mono in the Import Settings.
</li></ul>
