<p>There are two ways to reduce the size of the player built by Unity iPhone:
</p><ol><li>changing the <span class='doc-keyword'>Active Build Configuration</span> within Xcode; or
</li><li>changing the <span class='doc-keyword'>Stripping Level</span> within Unity iPhone.
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Building in Release Mode</h2>
<p>After building your Xcode project folder, it is possible to select <span class='doc-keyword'>Debug</span> or <span class='doc-keyword'>Release</span> from a the <span class='doc-keyword'>Active Build Configuration</span> drop-down menu. Building as <span class='doc-keyword'>Release</span> instead of <span class='doc-keyword'>Debug</span> will reduce your built player size by up to 2-3MB, depending on your game.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/iphone-playerSizeOptimization-0.jpg' /><br /><em>The Active Build Configuration drop-down</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>The trade-off for building a Release Build is that all debug information is stripped from the player, so if your game crashes or has other problems, no stack trace information is output.  In these cases, it is best to build a Debug version of your game and reproduce the crash so you get full debug information.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><b>Note:</b>
Select earliest possible target in Xcode. Today best solution is OS 2.2.1. This won't affect functionality of your game as some 90% of your game code is compiled before Xcode, so selecting newer target OS you just artificially limit your market.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>iPhone Stripping Level (Advanced License feature)</h2>
<p>Stripping-related size optimizations work in following way:  
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A) <span class='doc-keyword'>Strip assemblies</span> level: script byte code is analyzed. 
Classes and methods that are not referenced from the scripts are removed from the DLLs and are also excluded from the AOT step.
This optimization reduces the size of the main binary and accompanying DLLs. This feature is safe when no reflection is used.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>B) <span class='doc-keyword'>Strip ByteCode</span> level: accompanying .NET DLLs (stored in the Data folder) are stripped down to metadata only. This is possible because all the code is already precompiled with the AOT and linked into the main binary.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>C) <span class='doc-keyword'>Use micro mscorlib</span> level: a special, smaller version of mscorlib is used. Some components are removed from this library, for example: Security, Reflection.Emit, Remoting, non Gregorian calendars, etc. Also, internal component inter-dependencies are minimized.
This optimization reduces the main binary and mscorlib.dll size. This feature is not compatible with some System and System.Xml assembly classes, so use it with care.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><b>Note:</b> These levels are accumulative, so level (C) optimization includes both levels (B) and (A), and level (B) optimization includes level (A).
</p>
<p class='vspace'><b>Note:</b> Micro mscorlib is a heavily stripped version of a core library. Only those items that are required by the Mono runtime on Unity engine remain. Best practice for using micro mscorlib is not to use any class/features of .NET that are not required by you application. GUIDs are a good example of what shouldn't be used; these could be easily replaced with custom made pseudo GUIDs and it would offer you both better performance and app size. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>How to deal with stripping when using Reflection</h3>
<p>Stripping heavily depends on static code analysis and sometimes it fails to do the job right, especially when dynamic features (like reflection) are used. In such cases some hinting what classes shouldn't be touched is needed. Unity iPhone supports per project custom stripping <em>black list</em>. The process is simple:
</p>
<p class='vspace'>1. Create <span class='doc-prop'>link.xml</span> file and place it directly into <span class='doc-prop'>Assets</span> (project root) folder.
</p>2. <span class='doc-prop'>link.xml</span> sample structure is as follows:<pre class='codelisting'>
&lt;linker&gt;
       &lt;assembly fullname="System.Web.Services"&gt;
               &lt;type fullname="System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapTypeStubInfo" preserve="all"/&gt;
               &lt;type fullname="System.Web.Services.Configuration.WebServicesConfigurationSectionHandler" preserve="all"/&gt;
       &lt;/assembly&gt;

       &lt;assembly fullname="System"&gt;
               &lt;type fullname="System.Net.Configuration.WebRequestModuleHandler" preserve="all"/&gt;
               &lt;type fullname="System.Net.HttpRequestCreator" preserve="all"/&gt;
               &lt;type fullname="System.Net.FileWebRequestCreator" preserve="all"/&gt;
       &lt;/assembly&gt;
&lt;/linker&gt;
</pre> 
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Simple checklist how to make your distribution as small as possible</h3>
<ol><li>Minimize your assets: make all textures PVRTC compressed if possible; minimize uncompressed sounds. Check file size reduction documentation <a href="../Manual/Reducing File size.html">here</a>
</li><li>Set iPhone Stripping Level to <span class='doc-keyword'>Use micro mscorlib</span>.
</li><li>Set script call optimization to <span class='doc-keyword'>Fast but no exceptions</span>.
</li><li>Don't use anything that lives in System.dll or System.Xml.dll in your code. Those two are <b>not</b> compatible with micro mscorlib.
</li><li>Remove unnecessary code dependencies
</li><li>Remove unnecessary assets, use PVRTC compression for all textures, reduce texture resolution if possible
</li><li>Disable <span class='doc-keyword'>Enable Unity networking</span> tick in Player Settings.
</li><li>Use <span class='doc-keyword'>.Net 1.1</span> as Api Compatibility Level.
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Can I go below 10 mega bytes with Unity iPhone?</h3>
<p>Yes, if you own an Advanced License (required for the stripping option) and your game is small and uses low resolution textures and has a low polygon count. An empty scene with just the main camera will take up about 6 MB in the AppStore (zipped and DRM attached). For this reason, aiming for games below 10 MB with Unity iPhone isn't the best use of your time unless it is absolutely critical to your project. We are looking at additional ways to reduce the player size and improve the stripping abilities, but with the current version, if you want to build a game that offers anything substantive you'll go over 10 MB with Unity iPhone.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>My app has grown in size when released to AppStore. What should we do to to keep the size from growing?</h3>
<p>When published to the AppStore, Apple first encrypts the binary file and then compresses it via zip. Most often Apple's DRM increases binary size about 4 MB or so. As a general rule you may expect the "final" size to be approximately: The size of the zip compressed archive of all files except the executable + the size of the uncompressed executable file.
Please read the short list above about how to get the distribution size as small as possible.
