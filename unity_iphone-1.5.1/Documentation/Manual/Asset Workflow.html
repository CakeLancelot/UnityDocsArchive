<p>Here we'll explain the steps to use a single asset with Unity.  These steps are general and are meant only as an overview for basic actions.  For the example, we'll talk about using a 3D mesh.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Create Rough Asset</h2>
<p>Use any supported 3D modeling package to create a rough version of your asset.  Our example will use Maya.  Work with the asset until you are ready to save.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Import</h2>
<p>When you save your asset initially, you should save it normally to the <span class='doc-keyword'>Assets</span> folder in your Project folder.  When you open the Unity project, the asset will be detected and imported into the project.  When you look in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span>, you'll see the asset located there, right where you saved it.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Import Settings</h2>
<p>If you select the asset in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Project View</span> the import settings for this asset will appear in the <span class='doc-keyword'>Inspector</span>. The options that are displayed will change based on the type of asset that is selected.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Adding Asset to the Scene</h2>
<p>Simply click and drag the mesh from the Project View to the <span class='doc-keyword'>Hierarchy</span> or <span class='doc-keyword'>Scene View</span> to add it to the Scene.  When you drag a mesh to the scene, you are creating a <span class='doc-keyword'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span></span> that has a <span class='doc-prop'>Mesh Renderer</span> <span class='doc-keyword'>Component</span>.  If you are working with a texture or a sound file, you will have to add it to a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> that already exists in the Scene or Project.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Putting Different Assets Together</h2>
<p>Here is a brief description of the relationships between the most common assets
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>A Texture is applied to a <span class='doc-keyword'>Material</span>
</li><li>A Material is applied to a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> (with a Mesh Renderer Component)
</li><li>An <span class='doc-prop'>Animation</span> is applied to a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> (with an Animation Component)
</li><li>A sound file is applied to a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> (with an <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> Component)
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Creating a Prefab</h2>
<p><span class='doc-keyword'>Prefabs</span> are a collection of <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span> &amp; Components that can be re-used in your scenes.  Several identical objects can be created from a single Prefab, called instancing.  Take trees for example.  Creating a tree Prefab will allow you to instance several identical trees and place them in your scene.  Because the trees are all linked to the Prefab, any changes that are made to the Prefab will automatically be applied to all tree instances.  So if you want to change the mesh, material, or anything else, you just make the change once in the Prefab and all the other trees inherit the change.  You can also make changes to an instance, and choose <span class='doc-menu'><span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span>-&gt;Apply Changes to Prefab</span> from the main menu.  This can save you lots of time during setup and updating of assets.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>When you have a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> that contains multiple Components and a hierarchy of child <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>, you can make a Prefab of the top-level <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> (or <span class='doc-keyword'>root</span>), and re-use the entire collection of <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Think of a Prefab as a blueprint for a structure of <span class='wikiword'>GameObjects</span>.  All the Prefab clones are identical to the blueprint.  Therefore, if the blueprint is updated, so are all the clones.  There are different ways you can update the Prefab itself by changing one of its clones and applying those changes to the blueprint.  To read more about using and updating Prefabs, please view the <a href="../Manual/Prefabs.html">Prefabs</a> page.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To actually create a Prefab from a <span class='wikiword'>GameObject</span> in your scene, first create a new Prefab in your Project View.  Name the new Prefab whatever you like.  Then, click on the Game Object in the scene that you want to make into a Prefab.  Drag it to the new Prefab, and you should see the Game Object's name text turn blue.  You have now created a re-usable prefab.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Updating Assets</h2>
<p>You have imported, instantiated, and linked your asset to a Prefab.  Now when you want to edit your source asset, just double-click it from the Project View.  The appropriate application will launch, and you can make any changes you want.  When you're done updating it, just Save it.  Then, when you switch back to Unity, the update will be detected, and the asset will be re-imported.  The asset's link to the Prefab will also be maintained.  So the effect you will see is that your Prefab will update.  That's all you have to know to update assets.  Just open it and save!
